1,"September 21, 2010, 03:27:08 PM","Bitcoin is something radically new. Nothing like Bitcoin has been possible until now. I would go so far as to consider it sui generis; ""in its own class"".  This makes it important to understand what Bitcoin actually is before we try to describe it to others. We're getting a good handle on the code, and of course on Bitcoin's function and utility, but what words should we use to describe Bitcoin itself? There has been some debate in other threads [mostly my doing] over how it is like/not like money, cash, dollars, etc. I'd like to start this thread by focusing on the term ""money"", and play Devil's avocate by asking for your best arguments that Bitcoin IS money. My legal dictionary states ""In usual and ordinary acceptation it [money] means gold, silver, or paper money, used as circulating medium of exchange, and does not embrace notes, bonds, evidences of debt, or other personal or real estate."" [cites omitted]Wikipedia says ""Money is any object that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given country or socio-economic context. The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, occasionally, a standard of deferred payment."" [cited omitted]Webster's Online Dictionary defines money as: 1. The most common medium of exchange; functions as legal tender; ""we tried to collect the money he owed us"".2. Wealth reckoned in terms of money; ""all his money is in real estate"".3. The official currency issued by a government or national bank; ""he changed his money into francs"".4. A piece of metal, as gold, silver, copper, etc., coined, or stamped, and issued by the sovereign authority as a medium of exchange in financial transactions between citizens and with government; also, any number of such pieces; coin.5. Any written or stamped promise, certificate, or order, as a government note, a bank note, a certificate of deposit, etc., which is payable in standard coined money and is lawfully current in lieu of it; in a comprehensive sense, any currency usually and lawfully employed in buying and selling.6. In general, wealth; property; as, he has much money in land, or in stocks; to make, or lose, money.[links omitted][/list]I maintain that per these definitions, Bitcoin cannot possibly be described as ""money"". And further, I think that those who do describe Bitcoin as ""money"" are doing this community a disservice.But that is just my point of view. Are there any that can convincingly argue otherwise, that Bitcoin IS money?","June 21, 2011, 02:02:54 AM","The policy to not remove anything worked when the forum was small.

If you do, your thread will be moved to the Web Wallets section.Blockchain.info's web wallet is considered a poorly written wallet and is seemingly incapable of sending proper transactions with correct transaction fees and confirmed inputs. If you are using blockchain.info's web wallet and your transaction is stuck, it is almost definitely because the transaction fee is too low (at 120 sat/byte which seems to be blockchain.info's default fee rate even though it is much too low) or because you are spending from other unconfirmed transactions.If you are using blockchain.info's web wallet, unfortunately you won't be able to attempt RBF or CPFP transactions as blockchain.info does not provide the advanced functionality to make those transactions. All you can do is ask miners for help and wait. For asking miners for help:Quote from: achow101 on February 23, 2017, 08:50:24 PMAsk a miner for helpSome mining pools and miners offer services to allow you to prioritize your transaction in their mempool so that it is chosen sooner for inclusion in a block. You can contact the users Quickseller and macbook-air. These two users have access to F2Pool's transaction selector and they can help you with confirming your stuck transaction. You can also try using https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/ to ""accelerate"" your transaction. Note that ViaBTC does have a limit the accelerator to 100 transactions every hour and requires that it pays a minimum fee rate of 10 satoshis/byte, so their accelerator may not necessarily work.To avoid this problem in the future, stop using blockchain.info. Instead switch to any wallet listed on Bitcoin.org and has one of the following texts regarding how the wallet handles transaction fees:QuoteFull control over feesQuoteDynamic fee with overrideQuoteDynamic fee suggestionsAny wallet which has one of these texts for in their descriptions (with the color and bolding) will support dynamic fees and allow you to make transactions with proper fee rates.

Introduction in the introduction into circulation of 3 600 000 000 Unitlife.11 September 2017 held an official meeting with the Ambassador of the Republic of Indonesia Mohamad Wahid Supriadi in Irkutsk, Russia. At the meeting there were 5 major organizations such as the international airport, including UNION. CEO UNION, discussed with the ambassadors the question about the launch of cryptocurrency UnitLife and what benefits it can bring to the territory of Indonesia. The meeting was held at a high level. Most of priatnoe that meeting with us was the first, after the Ambassador went to meet with the Governor of the Irkutsk region.             20 September 2017 in Irkutsk, Russia, was conducted an official meeting with the Ambassador of the Republic of Lithuania Remigijus Motuzas. At the meeting there were 4 such large organizations as a network of pharmacies AVICENNA, including the UNION. Discussed the launch of cryptocurrency unitlife and the platform of the UNION. Is in the Republic of Lithuania, followed by the infusion of money in IT development. We agreed to meet in Moscow in Embassy. At the administrative level will provide partners in the Republic of LithuaniaToday our city, Irkutsk, received a delegation from Poland. Business mission headed by the Ambassador of Poland Vladimir Marciniak. 5 international companies from Poland and 50 largest companies in the Irkutsk region, including our site UNION Polish Business Club in Moscow.

Granted, China is a big contributor for the rise and adoption of Bitcoin and they are primarily the country involved with Bitcoin mining due to very cheap electricity cost. Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform. I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm.

","September 19, 2017, 12:54:07 PM",Should I Invest In Bitcoin?,"September 19, 2017, 02:05:55 PM","Bitcoin Core version *0.15.0.1* is now available from:  <https://bitcoin.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.15.0.1/>and   <https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.15.0.1/>This is a new major version release, including new features, various bugfixesand performance improvements, as well as updated translations.Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:  <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues>To receive security and update notifications, please subscribe to:  <https://bitcoincore.org/en/list/announcements/join/>How to Upgrade==============If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completelyshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).The first time you run version 0.15.0, your chainstate database will be converted to anew format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,depending on the speed of your machine.The file format of `fee_estimates.dat` changed in version 0.15.0. Hence, adowngrade from version 0.15.0 or upgrade to version 0.15.0 will cause all feeestimates to be discarded.Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is noautomatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0. Upgradingdirectly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported.However, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.Downgrading warning-------------------The chainstate database for this release is not compatible with previousreleases, so if you run 0.15 and then decide to switch back to anyolder version, you will need to run the old release with the `-reindex-chainstate`option to rebuild the chainstate data structures in the old format.If your node has pruning enabled, this will entail re-downloading andprocessing the entire blockchain.Compatibility==============Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems usingthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is notfrequently tested on them.Notes for 0.15.0.1===================GUI startup crash issue-------------------------After upgrade to 0.15.0, some clients would crash at startup because a customfee setting was configured that no longer exists in the GUI. This is a minimalpatch to avoid this issue from occuring.Notes for 0.15.0================Current SegWit support----------------------Version 0.15.0 supports adding a segregated witness address via the `addwitnessaddress` RPC, butplease note that this is a testing/expert RPC, which does not guarantee recovery from backup. Only usethis RPC if you know what you are doing. More complete wallet support for segregated witness is comingin a next version.Rescanning with encrypted wallets---------------------------------As in previous versions, when using an encrypted HD wallet, the keypool cannot be topped up without unlockingthe wallet. This means that currently, in order to recover from a backup of an encrypted HD wallet, the usermust unlock the wallet with a really long timeout and manually trigger a rescan, otherwise they risk missingsome keys when auto-topup cannot run. Unfortunately there is no `rescan` RPC in this version, that will beincluded in a future version, so for now a rescan can be triggered using one of the `import*` commands, usinga dummy address generated by another (trusted) wallet.Notable changes===============Performance Improvements------------------------Version 0.15 contains a number of significant performance improvements, which makeInitial Block Download, startup, transaction and block validation much faster:- The chainstate database (which is used for tracking UTXOs) has been changed  from a per-transaction model to a per-output model (See [PR 10195](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10195)). Advantages of this model  are that it:    - avoids the CPU overhead of deserializing and serializing the unused outputs;    - has more predictable memory usage;    - uses simpler code;    - is adaptable to various future cache flushing strategies.  As a result, validating the blockchain during Initial Block Download (IBD) and reindex  is ~30-40% faster, uses 10-20% less memory, and flushes to disk far less frequently.  The only downside is that the on-disk database is 15% larger. During the conversion from the previous format  a few extra gigabytes may be used.- Earlier versions experienced a spike in memory usage while flushing UTXO updates to disk.  As a result, only half of the available memory was actually used as cache, and the other half was  reserved to accommodate flushing. This is no longer the case (See [PR 10148](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10148)), and the entirety of  the available cache (see `-dbcache`) is now actually used as cache. This reduces the flushing  frequency by a factor 2 or more.- In previous versions, signature validation for transactions has been cached when the  transaction is accepted to the mempool. Version 0.15 extends this to cache the entire script  validity (See [PR 10192](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10192)). This means that if a transaction in a block has already been accepted to the  mempool, the scriptSig does not need to be re-evaluated. Empirical tests show that  this results in new block validation being 40-50% faster.- LevelDB has been upgraded to version 1.20 (See [PR 10544](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10544)). This version contains hardware acceleration for CRC  on architectures supporting SSE 4.2. As a result, synchronization and block validation are now faster.- SHA256 hashing has been optimized for architectures supporting SSE 4 (See [PR 10821](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10821)). SHA256 is around  50% faster on supported hardware, which results in around 5% faster IBD and block  validation. In version 0.15, SHA256 hardware optimization is disabled in release builds by  default, but can be enabled by using `--enable-experimental-asm` when building.- Refill of the keypool no longer flushes the wallet between each key which resulted in a ~20x speedup in creating a new wallet. Part of this speedup was used to increase the default keypool to 1000 keys to make recovery more robust. (See [PR 10831](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10831)).Fee Estimation Improvements---------------------------Fee estimation has been significantly improved in version 0.15, with more accurate fee estimates used by the wallet and a wider range of options for advanced users of the `estimatesmartfee` and `estimaterawfee` RPCs (See [PR 10199](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10199)).### Changes to internal logic and wallet behavior- Internally, estimates are now tracked on 3 different time horizons. This allows for longer targets and means estimates adjust more quickly to changes in conditions.- Estimates can now be *conservative* or *economical*. *Conservative* estimates use longer time horizons to produce an estimate which is less susceptible to rapid changes in fee conditions. *Economical* estimates use shorter time horizons and will be more affected by short-term changes in fee conditions. Economical estimates may be considerably lower during periods of low transaction activity (for example over weekends), but may result in transactions being unconfirmed if prevailing fees increase rapidly.- By default, the wallet will use conservative fee estimates to increase the reliability of transactions being confirmed within the desired target. For transactions that are marked as replaceable, the wallet will use an economical estimate by default, since the fee can be 'bumped' if the fee conditions change rapidly (See [PR 10589](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10589)).- Estimates can now be made for confirmation targets up to 1008 blocks (one week).- More data on historical fee rates is stored, leading to more precise fee estimates.- Transactions which leave the mempool due to eviction or other non-confirmed reasons are now taken into account by the fee estimation logic, leading to more accurate fee estimates.- The fee estimation logic will make sure enough data has been gathered to return a meaningful estimate. If there is insufficient data, a fallback default fee is used.### Changes to fee estimate RPCs- The `estimatefee` RPC is now deprecated in favor of using only `estimatesmartfee` (which is the implementation used by the GUI)- The `estimatesmartfee` RPC interface has been changed (See [PR 10707](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10707)):    - The `nblocks` argument has been renamed to `conf_target` (to be consistent with other RPC methods).    - An `estimate_mode` argument has been added. This argument takes one of the following strings: `CONSERVATIVE`, `ECONOMICAL` or `UNSET` (which defaults to `CONSERVATIVE`).    - The RPC return object now contains an `errors` member, which returns errors encountered during processing.    - If Bitcoin Core has not been running for long enough and has not seen enough blocks or transactions to produce an accurate fee estimation, an error will be returned (previously a value of -1 was used to indicate an error, which could be confused for a feerate).- A new `estimaterawfee` RPC is added to provide raw fee data. External clients can query and use this data in their own fee estimation logic.Multi-wallet support--------------------Bitcoin Core now supports loading multiple, separate wallets (See [PR 8694](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8694), [PR 10849](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10849)). The wallets are completely separated, with individual balances, keys and received transactions.Multi-wallet is enabled by using more than one `-wallet` argument when starting Bitcoin, either on the command line or in the Bitcoin config file.**In Bitcoin-Qt, only the first wallet will be displayed and accessible for creating and signing transactions.** GUI selectable multiple wallets will be supported in a future version. However, even in 0.15 other loaded wallets will remain synchronized to the node's current tip in the background. This can be useful if running a pruned node, since loading a wallet where the most recent sync is beyond the pruned height results in having to download and revalidate the whole blockchain. Continuing to synchronize all wallets in the background avoids this problem.Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 contains the following changes to the RPC interface and `bitcoin-cli` for multi-wallet:* When running Bitcoin Core with a single wallet, there are **no** changes to the RPC interface or `bitcoin-cli`. All RPC calls and `bitcoin-cli` commands continue to work as before.* When running Bitcoin Core with multi-wallet, all *node-level* RPC methods continue to work as before. HTTP RPC requests should be send to the normal `<RPC IP address>:<RPC port>/` endpoint, and `bitcoin-cli` commands should be run as before. A *node-level* RPC method is any method which does not require access to the wallet.* When running Bitcoin Core with multi-wallet, *wallet-level* RPC methods must specify the wallet for which they're intended in every request. HTTP RPC requests should be send to the `<RPC IP address>:<RPC port>/wallet/<wallet name>/` endpoint, for example `127.0.0.1:8332/wallet/wallet1.dat/`. `bitcoin-cli` commands should be run with a `-rpcwallet` option, for example `bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=wallet1.dat getbalance`.* A new *node-level* `listwallets` RPC method is added to display which wallets are currently loaded. The names returned by this method are the same as those used in the HTTP endpoint and for the `rpcwallet` argument.Note that while multi-wallet is now fully supported, the RPC multi-wallet interface should be considered unstable for version 0.15.0, and there may backwards-incompatible changes in future versions.Replace-by-fee control in the GUI---------------------------------Bitcoin Core has supported creating opt-in replace-by-fee (RBF) transactionssince version 0.12.0, and since version 0.14.0 has included a `bumpfee` RPC method toreplace unconfirmed opt-in RBF transactions with a new transaction that paysa higher fee.In version 0.15, creating an opt-in RBF transaction and replacing the unconfirmedtransaction with a higher-fee transaction are both supported in the GUI (See [PR 9592](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9592)).Removal of Coin Age Priority----------------------------In previous versions of Bitcoin Core, a portion of each block could be reserved for transactions based on the age and value of UTXOs they spent. This concept (Coin Age Priority) is a policy choice by miners, and there are no consensus rules around the inclusion of Coin Age Priority transactions in blocks. In practice, only a few miners continue to use Coin Age Priority for transaction selection in blocks. Bitcoin Core 0.15 removes all remaining support for Coin Age Priority (See [PR 9602](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9602)). This has the following implications:- The concept of *free transactions* has been removed. High Coin Age Priority transactions would previously be allowed to be relayed even if they didn't attach a miner fee. This is no longer possible since there is no concept of Coin Age Priority. The `-limitfreerelay` and `-relaypriority` options which controlled relay of free transactions have therefore been removed.- The `-sendfreetransactions` option has been removed, since almost all miners do not include transactions which do not attach a transaction fee.- The `-blockprioritysize` option has been removed.- The `estimatepriority` and `estimatesmartpriority` RPCs have been removed.- The `getmempoolancestors`, `getmempooldescendants`, `getmempoolentry` and `getrawmempool` RPCs no longer return `startingpriority` and `currentpriority`.- The `prioritisetransaction` RPC no longer takes a `priority_delta` argument, which is replaced by a `dummy` argument for backwards compatibility with clients using positional arguments. The RPC is still used to change the apparent fee-rate of the transaction by using the `fee_delta` argument.- `-minrelaytxfee` can now be set to 0. If `minrelaytxfee` is set, then fees smaller than `minrelaytxfee` (per kB) are rejected from relaying, mining and transaction creation. This defaults to 1000 satoshi/kB.- The `-printpriority` option has been updated to only output the fee rate and hash of transactions included in a block by the mining code.Mempool Persistence Across Restarts-----------------------------------Version 0.14 introduced mempool persistence across restarts (the mempool is saved to a `mempool.dat` file in the data directory prior to shutdown and restores the mempool when the node is restarted). Version 0.15 allows this feature to be switched on or off using the `-persistmempool` command-line option (See [PR 9966](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9966)). By default, the option is set to true, and the mempool is saved on shutdown and reloaded on startup. If set to false, the `mempool.dat` file will not be loaded on startup or saved on shutdown.New RPC methods---------------Version 0.15 introduces several new RPC methods:- `abortrescan` stops current wallet rescan, e.g. when triggered by an `importprivkey` call (See [PR 10208](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10208)).- `combinerawtransaction` accepts a JSON array of raw transactions and combines them into a single raw transaction (See [PR 10571](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10571)).- `estimaterawfee` returns raw fee data so that customized logic can be implemented to analyze the data and calculate estimates. See [Fee Estimation Improvements](#fee-estimation-improvements) for full details on changes to the fee estimation logic and interface.- `getchaintxstats` returns statistics about the total number and rate of transactions  in the chain (See [PR 9733](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9733)).- `listwallets` lists wallets which are currently loaded. See the *Multi-wallet* section  of these release notes for full details (See [Multi-wallet support](#multi-wallet-support)).- `uptime` returns the total runtime of the `bitcoind` server since its last start (See [PR 10400](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10400)).Low-level RPC changes---------------------- When using Bitcoin Core in multi-wallet mode, RPC requests for wallet methods must specify  the wallet that they're intended for. See [Multi-wallet support](#multi-wallet-support) for full details.- The new database model no longer stores information about transaction  versions of unspent outputs (See [Performance improvements](#performance-improvements)). This means that:  - The `gettxout` RPC no longer has a `version` field in the response.  - The `gettxoutsetinfo` RPC reports `hash_serialized_2` instead of `hash_serialized`,    which does not commit to the transaction versions of unspent outputs, but does    commit to the height and coinbase information.  - The `getutxos` REST path no longer reports the `txvers` field in JSON format,    and always reports 0 for transaction versions in the binary format- The `estimatefee` RPC is deprecated. Clients should switch to using the `estimatesmartfee` RPC, which returns better fee estimates. See [Fee Estimation Improvements](#fee-estimation-improvements) for full details on changes to the fee estimation logic and interface.- The `gettxoutsetinfo` response now contains `disk_size` and `bogosize` instead of  `bytes_serialized`. The first is a more accurate estimate of actual disk usage, but  is not deterministic. The second is unrelated to disk usage, but is a  database-independent metric of UTXO set size: it counts every UTXO entry as 50 + the  length of its scriptPubKey (See [PR 10426](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10426)).- `signrawtransaction` can no longer be used to combine multiple transactions into a single transaction. Instead, use the new `combinerawtransaction` RPC (See [PR 10571](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10571)).- `fundrawtransaction` no longer accepts a `reserveChangeKey` option. This option used to allow RPC users to fund a raw transaction using an key from the keypool for the change address without removing it from the available keys in the keypool. The key could then be re-used for a `getnewaddress` call, which could potentially result in confusing or dangerous behaviour (See [PR 10784](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10784)).- `estimatepriority` and `estimatesmartpriority` have been removed. See [Removal of Coin Age Priority](#removal-of-coin-age-priority).- The `listunspent` RPC now takes a `query_options` argument (see [PR 8952](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8952)), which is a JSON object  containing one or more of the following members:  - `minimumAmount` - a number specifying the minimum value of each UTXO  - `maximumAmount` - a number specifying the maximum value of each UTXO  - `maximumCount` - a number specifying the minimum number of UTXOs  - `minimumSumAmount` - a number specifying the minimum sum value of all UTXOs- The `getmempoolancestors`, `getmempooldescendants`, `getmempoolentry` and `getrawmempool` RPCs no longer return `startingpriority` and `currentpriority`. See [Removal of Coin Age Priority](#removal-of-coin-age-priority).- The `dumpwallet` RPC now returns the full absolute path to the dumped wallet. It  used to return no value, even if successful (See [PR 9740](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9740)).- In the `getpeerinfo` RPC, the return object for each peer now returns an `addrbind` member, which contains the ip address and port of the connection to the peer. This is in addition to the `addrlocal` member which contains the ip address and port of the local node as reported by the peer (See [PR 10478](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10478)).- The `disconnectnode` RPC can now disconnect a node specified by node ID (as well as by IP address/port). To disconnect a node based on node ID, call the RPC with the new `nodeid` argument (See [PR 10143](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10143)).- The second argument in `prioritisetransaction` has been renamed from `priority_delta` to `dummy` since Bitcoin Core no longer has a concept of coin age priority. The `dummy` argument has no functional effect, but is retained for positional argument compatibility. See [Removal of Coin Age Priority](#removal-of-coin-age-priority).- The `resendwallettransactions` RPC throws an error if the `-walletbroadcast` option is set to false (See [PR 10995](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10995)).- The second argument in the `submitblock` RPC argument has been renamed from `parameters` to `dummy`. This argument never had any effect, and the renaming is simply to communicate this fact to the user (See [PR 10191](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10191))  (Clients should, however, use positional arguments for `submitblock` in order to be compatible with BIP 22.)- The `verbose` argument of `getblock` has been renamed to `verbosity` and now takes an integer from 0 to 2. Verbose level 0 is equivalent to `verbose=false`. Verbose level 1 is equivalent to `verbose=true`. Verbose level 2 will give the full transaction details of each transaction in the output as given by `getrawtransaction`. The old behavior of using the `verbose` named argument and a boolean value is still maintained for compatibility.- Error codes have been updated to be more accurate for the following error cases (See [PR 9853](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9853)):  - `getblock` now returns RPC_MISC_ERROR if the block can't be found on disk (for  example if the block has been pruned). Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.  - `pruneblockchain` now returns RPC_MISC_ERROR if the blocks cannot be pruned  because the node is not in pruned mode. Previously returned RPC_METHOD_NOT_FOUND.  - `pruneblockchain` now returns RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if the blocks cannot be pruned  because the supplied timestamp is too late. Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.  - `pruneblockchain` now returns RPC_MISC_ERROR if the blocks cannot be pruned  because the blockchain is too short. Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.  - `setban` now returns RPC_CLIENT_INVALID_IP_OR_SUBNET if the supplied IP address  or subnet is invalid. Previously returned RPC_CLIENT_NODE_ALREADY_ADDED.  - `setban` now returns RPC_CLIENT_INVALID_IP_OR_SUBNET if the user tries to unban  a node that has not previously been banned. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.  - `removeprunedfunds` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if `bitcoind` is unable to remove  the transaction. Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.  - `removeprunedfunds` now returns RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if the transaction does not  exist in the wallet. Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.  - `fundrawtransaction` now returns RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY if an invalid change  address is provided. Previously returned RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER.  - `fundrawtransaction` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if `bitcoind` is unable to create  the transaction. The error message provides further details. Previously returned  RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if the provided transaction has  descendants in the wallet. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if the provided transaction has  descendants in the mempool. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction has  has been mined or conflicts with a mined transaction. Previously returned  RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY.  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction is not  BIP 125 replaceable. Previously returned RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY.  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction has already  been bumped by a different transaction. Previously returned RPC_INVALID_REQUEST.  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction contains  inputs which don't belong to this wallet. Previously returned RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY.  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction has multiple change  outputs. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction has no change  output. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the fee is too high.

Although those who use and support bitcoin still make up a smaller percentage of the world's population, in the millennial generation of investors, the number of young people who turn away from traditional financial empires is growing. If this trend continues, it could mean an absolute collapse of the banking system, as it continues to adhere to outdated algorithms. Until now, there is some way, until even the most seasoned investors are completely free of traditional banking and monetary institutions, but today they can already control their future in terms of investments. Since it is easier for them to manage their own savings plan by investing and reinvesting new technologies. Although they continue to deduct a certain percentage of the usual pension fund, and their accounts still have to be paid through a bank account, but investments in crypto-currencies have become for them a central part of savings.Investors and bitcoin owners must have their way to survive and keep bitcoin for a very long time. they are the ones who dare to take risks by entrusting entirely to bitcoin. the growing interest of investors like young people in this millennium era can ensure that in the future bitcoin will be increasingly in demand. so for those who want to hold bitcoin then they are sure of what they are doing.","October 08, 2017, 05:56:59 AM","Quote from: Itshowiroll on October 08, 2017, 04:21:48 AMGetting a job is not possible for everyone, not everyone has family or [friends] to help them and sometimes they will make the bad situations even worse them.

Huh?Gold has been around since the dawn of time. People give it value, it isn't capable of establishing anything because it's just a piece of shiny metal. If it wasn't shiny, it would be considered worthless.It all changes. Long ago bronze was also an expensive metal, used for making coins and so was copper. Nowadays we aren't using bronze plated jewelry, we aren't making coins from it, it became forgotten. Gold is valuable only because it's still being used to make jewelry and electronics, but it's already being pushed by other metals that are better, more valuable and more durable like platinum and titanium.

The miner is not available on the site new anymore.I'd be surprised if anyone actually bought miners without the intent of using them. They depreciate in value very significantly. The case I can think of are those who buy more than they can use in order to get a volume discount and then sell the remaining units.Also, it is very common for products to be ""burn in"" tested so by that definition, they would be ""used"".

That being said, with China, and now this rumor about Russia, I have to ask this question: how do you deal with the possibility that one day Bitcoin could be illegal in most countries? Is it a possibility? It is likely/unlikely? All opinions are welcome. Regards.Well, if there is one thing I learned in this world it is that nothing is really impossible...anything can happen as far as Bitcoin is concerned in connection with the many governments who are right now looking at Bitcoin with unkind eyes. They can ban Bitcoin or rather the use of Bitcoin in their own territories and they  have the power to do it as shown by what China did last month. Of course, technically they can't stop Bitcoin because they do not own the Bitcoin network but they can put regulations making it hard if not impossible for their citizens to deal with Bitcoin. Now, what can we do to help? Essentially, there is nothing we can do. The power of the government does not belong to us even if we can ideally say that all power emanates from the people (this power can be good in election days and not really all the time). Not all countries fully subscribed to the democratic ideals people in the West are upholding and practicing. This is a big reality we have to contend with. We can't create our own government and declare Bitcoin to be fully legal. Or maybe not for now.We can only hope that those countries already opened for Bitcoin will continue on supporting the cryptocurrency bandwagon and will not change their mindset about it.

Also, Bitmain usually mines with the units before they are sold so most units are not truly new even buying directly. The miner is not available on the site new anymore.I'd be surprised if anyone actually bought miners without the intent of using them. They depreciate in value very significantly. The case I can think of are those who buy more than they can use in order to get a volume discount and then sell the remaining units.Also, it is very common for products to be ""burn in"" tested so by that definition, they would be ""used"". That's actually a good thing since it cuts off a good part of the front of the ""bathtub curve"". (The back of the curve, like computer hardware in general, is not very relevant since the hardware would be long obsolete by then.)If electricity is free, the key factor to look at is hashing power per dollar. The S7 is pretty good if you have a well ventilated place to put it where the noise is not an issue. Also consider researching altcoins.In the case of Bitmain I've received dusty products that have been used for possibly days, which definitely sounds like they use them to mine for profit before selling em first.

When the price climb to $4100/btc, I sell my 0.184 btc to get my first capital and get $754.4 and 0.191 btc left .then when the price dump again to around $3900, I buy it again with my $754.4, so I get 0.193xxx btc and  my total btc is 0.384xx.

Your strategy is good because you did not lose anything since you already got back your capital and your profit is earning as well. In this way, you can multiply your coins in a short amount of time than just merely saving it in your wallet.

What role do you think scarcity and greed play in all this? Are you familiar with Quantum Physics? there is no certainty in anything whatsoever, you can't determine what the next event might be.Scientists shoot a particle at a board like school boards but first they set a small wall with 2 slots on it a few inches a part and when they see the results on the board, they see 2 dots instead of 1 if you consider the particles as colored dots or like a paint ball while they only shot 1 paint ball but they see the impacts of 2 as if right before going through those slots that one ball literally makes a clone of itself and goes from both slots.But that only happens in darkness they can then see the after effects, but when they decide to look at that 1 ball and see how can it make a copy of itself and all they see is 1 ball going through only one of the slots either the left or the right one as if light shines on it changes the behavior of extremely small particles.What it means that there is no 1 decision or action but every time we have to chose a path or select a color for our new smart phone we actually select all the available colors at the same time or in parallel realities(universes) so whatever you do and whatever you decide you will live to see the consequences, however though the universe(God) knows all the outcomes of all your decisions and actions and my point here is not to make things even more complicated than before but to tell you that only praying and asking God will work to change your fate whether it is about your daily life or the ultimate and final fate.","March 07, 2017, 08:34:57 AM","Quote from: CEJ on March 07, 2017, 06:52:52 AMNowadays many people are starting to invest money on bitcoin or the buy bitcoin..is this a good approach?Investing in Bitcoin has been a good approach if you intend to hold it for a long time.  It has been proven that holding it will yeild a person a profit.  Example of this are the people that invested in early years especially during 2015.  Quote from: CEJ on March 07, 2017, 06:52:52 AMHow this will influence us in future?This may influence us financially if we manage to wait for the right time to sell our BTC's.  or  we have learned trading and take advantage of Bitcoin price fluctuation.","March 07, 2017, 06:47:41 PM","My Bitcoin is mostly for future purpose and/or daily spending, or extra shopping that I might need...

I feel it's kind of a game to monopolize the price of Bitcoin, whatever sort of fud. Apart from China bitcoin remains alive even unstoppable.That is true. I don't why people are still talking about this shit when we have seen bitcoin remain very strong despite the news from china. Why is china all over this thread until now? Are we not contented that china is taking control of our houses and lives through all china-made products? I bet the PC you are using right now is either assembled or entirely made in china. "

Also the one offering the ICO can never prove he did not buy into it himself. So ico is complete scam normally. Don't be told otherwise by the scammers.

You cannot say all ICO's are scams, NXT and Ethereum are the 2 biggest successes in the market currently.If you can't mine you buy from someone who can.

What do you really want from Bitcoin in the future? We already know that Bitcoin is a digital currency  just like the country-issued and backed fiat monies we have all over the world which we usually use for paying anything. Aside from being a currency, Bitcoin is now also a very good speculative tool (or maybe also a toy) because of its immense volatility and that popular expectation that the value would rise significantly. In other words, many Bitcoin holders would want to earn money from this...they look at Bitcoin as an investment. In fact, this is the general mood for Bitcoin and that is why its use as a currency is relegated for now to the background. This is also the reason why there are those who continually warning us that Bitcoin can soon be a bubble that can burst or pop leaving many Bitcoin holders just having empty bags though in the face of so many factors and many recent development the bubble arguments seem to be weak (but we still have to be careful). It is all about earning more and more money...and this can also be where greed can come in. With greed, we have to be careful because it is a two-edged sword that can cut both ways.

Also the one offering the ICO can never prove he did not buy into it himself. So ico is complete scam normally. Don't be told otherwise by the scammers. The only legit way of distribution is mining - longterm mining, no flashmining. You're welcome. This doesn't make sense, what happens if you do not have the technical knowledge to mine or have the equipment? What if the developers want a lower cost energy coin using proof of stake? You cannot say all ICO's are scams, NXT and Ethereum are the 2 biggest successes in the market currently.If you can't mine you buy from someone who can. POS can have initial mining too, there is nothing that prevents a POS coin from having a fair distribution. Yes, i said all ico. Only because it's pumped later doesn't mean the distribution wasn't fraudulent. So someone who has a monopoly on mining equipment can own the supply? That is not a fair distribution.

Let's say they send you $1000 and with their wallet address, your service would create 1,000 new tokens and send them to that address and you'd add that $1,000 to your fund. Then when someone wants to cash in their tokens they'd call a smart contract sending their 1,000 tokens and account number to send the cash to. You'd have a service that detects the transaction and destroys the tokens and sends the dollars to their account.That's one way but I'm sure you can think of other ways to do it. Since you're promising to buy the tokens for $1 then the value should never drop below $1. Of course it might rise above $1 if someone decides the token has more utility than the dollars they're mapped to.Plutous does something similar but pegs another token to Bitcoin and there are other systems that peg to gold and dollars. For gold they create a serial number for the gold held in storage and attach it to the token so like with the above system there's a promise in principle to exchange 1 token for 1 gold unit so they're pegged together.","October 05, 2017, 10:41:58 AM","Quote from: jonathan6655321 on October 05, 2017, 10:15:45 AMis it risky to turn all my money to bitcoins? anyhow this money sits in the bank and do nothing for!You know what pal, there really is no such thing in this world that has greatness without risks.

There will always be supply and demand. Since August 1 is coming up, it should not pose a real problem to the blockchain network. If I recall correctly, the hard fork that can be the outcome of August 1 will not be a big problem as the old blockchain can still update itself once it realises that it as become outdated (I think, not 100% sure). Then, the network should remain the same as now. Bitcoin will continue to grow in popularity and also value. This can be seen through the adoption of Bitcoin by various large companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and more. They would not invest in such said technology and moreover would not allow you to pay with Bitcoins if they did not believe that bitcoin would grow.

The supreme court already ruled, that software of any kind is protected by the 1st amendment. There are nine categories, which are not considered 'free speech"" ( http://www.newseuminstitute.org/about/faq/which-types-of-speech-are-not-protected-by-the-first-amendment/ )In conclusion: Transfereing BTC from one wallet to another can not be banned under current US law. There are also technically problems to ban BTC. The wallets are anonymous (if you cloak your IP/dial-in via anon-service) so in order to ban BTC, the US government has to detach themselves from the internet, build an own national intra-net and ban anon-service. That way, they can see who is using BTC and prosecute the users of it.That will never happen, if you ask me. What the government actually can do is banning BTC from the exchanges so that you can't trade BTC into fiat currencies. That is all they can do, as far as I'm concern. But of course they can pull something illegal. Executive Order 6102 is considered unconstitutional today, it forbid US citizen and foreigners to own gold from 1933 to 1974.

China just started it they wanted to control something that is not meant to be controlled by a person or an institution and because of this china came up with a plan to ban bitcoin but in my opinion it is just a strategy to check how the market would react. Now that phase 1 was done they have to proceed with the next phase seeing that the market somehow got affected with the ban they can now come up with a strategy to manipulate it. So they're not banning bitcoin anymore instead they will impose rules which will be hard for the chinese market and due to these rules they now have a way to manipulate it and gain more profit from it."

You cannot debate that this is a fairer distribution method than ICO distribution because you know the same problems happen in each one.The miner has high up-front costs and also electricity costs. He doesn't get the coins for free. Also you need to pay attention to the distribution of hashpower to know what's going on. In minig at least it's transparent what's happening while ICO is a black box. I'm going to respectfully disagree and say that each one has the exact same problems of distribution. In mining, power costs vary from geomeric locality. So it is higher cost for some and lower for others, some also have a big monopoly on mining power, you can see this problem is prevalent in Bitcoin right now. The same happens with ICO's with who has the highest Bitcoin supply to there disposal, it is essentially the same problem with all distribution methods. But again it's personal preference.I really like the conversation though, it is great to see a miners perspective on distribution methods.

Aristotle discovered, formulated, and analyzed the problem of commensurability. He wondered how ratios for a fair exchange of heterogeneous things could be set. He searched for a principle that makes it possible to equate what is apparently unequal and non-comparable.Aristotle says that money, as a common measure of everything, makes things commensurable and makes it possible to equalize them. He states that it is in the form of money, a substance that has a telos (purpose), that individuals have devised a unit that supplies a measure on the basis of which just exchange can take place. Aristotle thus maintains that everything can be expressed in the universal equivalent of money. He explains that money was introduced to satisfy the requirement that all items exchanged must be comparable in some way.Within such frame work, Aristotle defined the characteristics of a good form of money:1.) It must be durable. Money must stand the test of time and the elements. It must not fade, corrode, or change through time.2.) It must be portable. Money hold a high amount of 'worth' relative to its weight and size.3.) It must be divisible. Money should be relatively easy to separate and re-combine without affecting its fundamental characteristics. An extension of this idea is that the item should be 'fungible'. Dictionary.com describes fungible as:""(esp. of goods) being of such nature or kind as to be freely exchangeable or replaceable, in whole or in part, for another of like nature or kind.""4.) It must have intrinsic value. This value of money should be independent of any other object and contained in the money itself.(snip)Fiat CurrencyMoney must be a good store of value by definition.Fiat paper currencies are popular at times since they are convenient and can be created at will to please the public. However fiat money fails the all important ""intrinsic value"" test, as its value is solely derived from legal tender laws. The compliance of such law rests on the credibility and strength of the issuing authority. As we know government and political factions can rise and fall faster than pop stars in some cases. It's no surprise that no fiat money has ever survived through time, and they can never be viable money regardless of technological breakthroughs or other human advances.""(end excerpt)Bitcoin is a currency because it can be, and is intended to be, used as a medium unit of exchange.  Yet it does not require the legal backing of any government; so it is not fiat.  Nor does it, presently, have any attribute that would imply a market value outside of the context of it's intended use as a medium of exchange.  As has been noted in other threads, Bitcoin is most like a LETS for the Internet, but even that analogy has it's faults.

Or you are just asking on where people will get more profit? Well let's say if your a developer or owner, both of them are profitable but gambling site will get more profit as you've got a lot of ways to earn from addicted gamblers unlike in dating site, you'll only get profit from exclusive membership.I want to know that suppose a person want to start/own one of them then what will be better option for him and what site will give him more traffic and more investors to get more money from the site.Based on observation and research about bitcoin and by reading different opinion on threads here on the forum. I conclude that most of crypto user here are a gambler and they bother to use BTC on dating site because there is a lot of free application out there that offers a dating features like tinder.

As currency? As an investment? or other?What is the reason?Bitcoin is called a cryptocurrency so certainly this is a currency in the same level as that of the US Dollar or any fiat money for that matter. However, right now, there seems to be a shortage of merchants accepting Bitcoin and there is no massive movement in terms of purchases from Bitcoin holders...but why? It is because Bitcoin is also a speculative coin meaning to say that many people are holding on to what they have in anticipation of a bigger value soon. And you can not blame these people since they invested with Bitcoin they must get the return that can be soon possible. Now, aside from being a currency, i consider Bitcoin also as a store of value akin to the real gold. We don't use gold in making purchases but it has a big value right now as a safe haven for many investors and big-time & moneyed people. Bitcoin is also like that. It can be a store of value.

When the price climb to $4100/btc, I sell my 0.184 btc to get my first capital and get $754.4 and 0.191 btc left .then when the price dump again to around $3900, I buy it again with my $754.4, so I get 0.193xxx btc and  my total btc is 0.384xx. With my $750 I can keep increase my bitcoin with this strategy. So what do you think. Am I doing right with my bitcoin? Or you have any advice. Please explain.That's what we call investing. You will use a capital to invest and when there's a return of investment, the profit will then again be used for another investment, in that way, your money will grow continuously.

When the price climb to $4100/btc, I sell my 0.184 btc to get my first capital and get $754.4 and 0.191 btc left .then when the price dump again to around $3900, I buy it again with my $754.4, so I get 0.193xxx btc and  my total btc is 0.384xx. With my $750 I can keep increase my bitcoin with this strategy. So what do you think. Am I doing right with my bitcoin? Or you have any advice. Please explain.Nice strategy.

But first overpopulation only occur in small countries, based from my own perception. Those that have larger regions don't have this kind of problem. Now back to my elaboration:1.) The immigration of people to other countries. This depends on the person. Immigration will help other people decrease the population in a overpopulated country.2.) Have a specific law that limits the children that a couple can have. Again this is also optional but can help to decrease overpopulation.3.) Stop fetishes. Simple as a sexual fetish such as ""preggy"" may lead to more and more children that the parent doesn't actually care about, abortion is also not a reason to accept these fetishes, it is morally wrong.4.) And lastly implement a program to educate all people about the causes of overpopulation in their country and that it is time for them to plan ahead for their future children.These are the four simple ways to decrease overpopulation.

The dip may be small but it's there.It's therefore possible to maximize earnings by selling and buying at exactly the right times, with risks of course.People who only hold have no such risks whatsoever and will have profit in the long run because Bitcoin's price always increases. It's just that the profit of those who make smart trading decisions will be higher than that of holders.This is the reason why they say that a good trader can make money when the price is up and also make some money when the price is down. But a person has to be good to win wherever the market is going. Otherwise, in the case of Bitcoin, ordinary guys just like me should just hold on to the Bitcoin we already have.

Well let's say if your a developer or owner, both of them are profitable but gambling site will get more profit as you've got a lot of ways to earn from addicted gamblers unlike in dating site, you'll only get profit from exclusive membership.I want to know that suppose a person want to start/own one of them then what will be better option for him and what site will give him more traffic and more investors to get more money from the site.We are in the industry where everyone wants to earn fast and with bitcoin that can be applied plus the anonymity of it.

When the price climb to $4100/btc, I sell my 0.184 btc to get my first capital and get $754.4 and 0.191 btc left .then when the price dump again to around $3900, I buy it again with my $754.4, so I get 0.193xxx btc and  my total btc is 0.384xx.

Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? Based on the stated scenario it would surely become a huge problem for the market. But let's stop making conspiracy's that they have those agenda's of disconnecting their citizens from cryptocurrencies. Let's just stay on facts, fact that they are banning ICO projects in their country because most of them are turning into scams which is very illegal and they don't want their citizens to be scammed again.

Although those who use and support bitcoin still make up a smaller percentage of the world's population, in the millennial generation of investors, the number of young people who turn away from traditional financial empires is growing.

Although they continue to deduct a certain percentage of the usual pension fund, and their accounts still have to be paid through a bank account, but investments in crypto-currencies have become for them a central part of savings.The only reason why thousands of investors holds bitcoin in troubled days is because they arr already used to it to the volatility of the market and most of them do know that bitcoin will recover and will definitely grow much higher and in the end all of them will benefit.","October 08, 2017, 02:41:45 PM","Quote from: Itshowiroll on October 08, 2017, 04:21:48 AMGetting a job is not possible for everyone, not everyone has family or [friends] to help them and sometimes they will make the bad situations even worse them.

I feel it's kind of a game to monopolize the price of Bitcoin, whatever sort of fud. Apart from China bitcoin remains alive even unstoppable.We are on the same conviction. Though, of course, we would be welcoming China back if they decide to eventually go for regulating Bitcoin rather than banning it, there are many repercussions that have to be discussed in regards to China. And I don't believe that the recent surge is based on the possibility that China can be back on the table. That can even be just another fake news. Instead, what we are witnessing is the market is now ignoring China and even the latest confusing news from Russia and all the negative comments from financial leaders in and out of USA. China is a big market (population-wise and interest-wise) and it can be a big push for Bitcoin in case the market can be re-open. Personally, however, I really doubt if this can happen in the short-term. People in the West sometimes failed to understand the ins and outs of the Chinese government. When the government feel that they are not getting anything out of a deal, they will not stake on it. The government is seeing Bitcoin as a possible problem rather than a big help for its economy. They might however formulate their own coin which they can control and manipulate and this is the best possibility I am seeing they would be doing. "

Swearing, SHOUTING etc. make your post more likely to be removed.2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL""3. No pointless or uninteresting threads.4. No referral code spam5. No NSFW content. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . These all sound reasonable to me, harmful but reasonable, number 1 is the most likely to be harmful to building the character of a robust community.I can see any number of posts that would be worthwhile and add to the character of this forum (to any forum) yet would fall foul of many of these caveats.For instance swearing is so culturally divisive that what might be seen as a genuine transgression by one person is simply humor (or more precisely 'humour') to another. From personal experience I know that - for example - Americans are can be offended by language that people from the UK are indifferent to, or even see as endearing, what to one person imbues a post with spirit and character to another renders it offensive.But of course nobody wants to have to 'listen' to someone hurling unnecessary and unwarranted abuse at another poster, so there is a real need to keep a check on this kind of thing, at least to some degree.I suggest you make a distinction between swearing per se and ad hominem, for example here are two examples . . .A) Oh, for fuck's sake I can't believe they've increased their fucking charges for THE SECOND TIME in a freaking month! This is really starting to piss me off, they are just going to drive business elsewhere . . . (and so on)B) It's clueless people like you who think you know it all, running around like some kind of genius telling everyone who will listen how great you think you are. Yet time after time you get it wrong and end up with the whole forum laughing at the sorry spectacle you have become, mostly through your own stupidity . . . (and so on). . . example A contains swearing yet is (to these ears at least) not in the least bit offensive, example B is pure ad hominem, likely to elicit a similar response and is corrosive to the conversation.If on the other hand there is simply going to be a list of censored words then why not just use the BB software to track and change them, much like a US religious forum, so 'shit' becomes 'poopy' - and 'no fucking way!' becomes 'no damn way'.Personally I think this kind of thing is a move in the wrong direction, I am a member of a cycling forum in the UK that has zero moderation and the tone and sense of community is something even the best drawn up list of rules could not come close to, the forum has grown from nothing to 50,000 + and suffers none of the problems lists of rules like these seek to address.It's fucking great ! ","December 15, 2016, 08:01:57 AM",It's a method of coin distribution. ,,,,,,,"December 25, 2016, 05:10:43 PM","I believe that man sets himself a difficult life.

There's no reason to have something rise 13x since you've purchased and then hold it until it loses 75% of that profit, just so you can make more profit down the road.I'd rather protect my profits, buy back with a smaller portion later -if i get the chance- and turn profit into more profit while also protecting atleast 50% of my previous gains.

Although those who use and support bitcoin still make up a smaller percentage of the world's population, in the millennial generation of investors, the number of young people who turn away from traditional financial empires is growing. If this trend continues, it could mean an absolute collapse of the banking system, as it continues to adhere to outdated algorithms. Until now, there is some way, until even the most seasoned investors are completely free of traditional banking and monetary institutions, but today they can already control their future in terms of investments. Since it is easier for them to manage their own savings plan by investing and reinvesting new technologies. Although they continue to deduct a certain percentage of the usual pension fund, and their accounts still have to be paid through a bank account, but investments in crypto-currencies have become for them a central part of savings.There's no aim for invester. An invester want profit so in order to get profit you have to work for long term. So invester always looking for long term rather than short term.

Things were put in FAQs like ""some users here have prickly shells, but we've grown to love them"". Now it changed overnight. Sure, everyone is free to leave this forum (and in effect leave bitcoin, because bitcoin is very linked to this forum). But it is unfair to mislead people so grossly. One day the biggest bitcoin forum is advertised as free speech, the next day there is no free speech.First the whole bitcoin is advertised as a libertarian currency in global media, then it quickly changes, because some early adopters from the United States want to safely cash out.

And what is it actually ?Thanks a lot if someone can help me.  ICO means by which funds are raised for a new cryptocurrency venture. It is used to bypass the regulated capital raising process required by banks , in the ICO campaign the percentage of cryptocurrency is sold to early backers of the project usually for bitcoins.Right now, the majority of ICOs are not anymore focusing on a single coin. Yes, bitcoin for some but for most they are using ETH. Others are accepting two to three coins for their project's ICO. Waves, Ripple, LTC, ETC are all being used for ICOs right now.

Although those who use and support bitcoin still make up a smaller percentage of the world's population, in the millennial generation of investors, the number of young people who turn away from traditional financial empires is growing. If this trend continues, it could mean an absolute collapse of the banking system, as it continues to adhere to outdated algorithms. Until now, there is some way, until even the most seasoned investors are completely free of traditional banking and monetary institutions, but today they can already control their future in terms of investments. Since it is easier for them to manage their own savings plan by investing and reinvesting new technologies. Although they continue to deduct a certain percentage of the usual pension fund, and their accounts still have to be paid through a bank account, but investments in crypto-currencies have become for them a central part of savings.Thousands of investors hold Bitcoin on troubled days because they are thinking of possibilities like the price will hit their desired target. Also, we are the one who control our investment here in crypto world, not even banks or any countries. One thing is tax wherein we can differentiate centralized and decentralized investments.

The opposite of a central bank(because we know that central banks int he end ruin everything).Normally for a bank, they issue you checks, which can be used to make payment to places that accept chekcs. the money is then taken out of your account by the bank and given to the other person.Bitcoin the same process happens. you setup your bitcoin adddress, fund it like you would fund your bank account, send people bitcoin for services/items. they receieve it. only the big difference is that It is secured by hash power, the hashpower is made up by miners, the miners validate everybody's transactions. Miners keep the network censorship free and secure. banks can do whatever they want with your money and freeze your assests(even if you do nothing wrong it can happen).

Although those who use and support bitcoin still make up a smaller percentage of the world's population, in the millennial generation of investors, the number of young people who turn away from traditional financial empires is growing. If this trend continues, it could mean an absolute collapse of the banking system, as it continues to adhere to outdated algorithms. Until now, there is some way, until even the most seasoned investors are completely free of traditional banking and monetary institutions, but today they can already control their future in terms of investments. Since it is easier for them to manage their own savings plan by investing and reinvesting new technologies. Although they continue to deduct a certain percentage of the usual pension fund, and their accounts still have to be paid through a bank account, but investments in crypto-currencies have become for them a central part of savings.I think those people are aware about its value. They know its the only currency work world wide and it have no fix price. When the price fall down they hold the bitcoins until it go up and this is how trade works and how the people who have bitcoins are earning. Those who do not follow this trend and scheme, often get panic when price is low and sell at a loss.","October 08, 2017, 09:55:24 PM","Quote from: Itshowiroll on October 08, 2017, 04:21:48 AMGetting a job is not possible for everyone, not everyone has family or [friends] to help them and sometimes they will make the bad situations even worse them.

The only thing that we should do is to hold because the market is so volatile and it can give us paper loss or paper gain within a few hours and if you want to become more efficient in investing then you need to remember to just hold when there is troubled days and buy at dips in troubled days so you can have a big discount and get a bigger chance to have fast profit when the market is up again.","October 09, 2017, 01:19:20 PM","Quote from: Itshowiroll on October 08, 2017, 04:21:48 AMGetting a job is not possible for everyone, not everyone has family or [friends] to help them and sometimes they will make the bad situations even worse them.

I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm. Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? Of course no, we've seen the price earlier in this year when china froze the withdrawal in some exchange. There's panic at first but after a few weeks the price become normal and it happen again right now(only rumor though). Crypto will keep growing even without china.Ya true.

Granted, China is a big contributor for the rise and adoption of Bitcoin and they are primarily the country involved with Bitcoin mining due to very cheap electricity cost. Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform. I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm. Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? It would be really funny that BTC is depends only on China and we all know that is not true,but they have big influence on mining&trading.Their decisions greatly affect BTC price as we can see in the past few days.I think they decided to introduce greater control on exchanges and ICO in attempt to stop their citizens to exchange domestic currency in any form of cryptocurrency.Maybe it would be best that in some way they succeed in their plans and make things how they want to be, so in future we stop to see such things coming from China.I think even without China BTC have future,such events can only slow down progress but can not stop BTC - too much money&interest is in this game and the game will continue with or without China.","September 19, 2017, 08:26:51 PM","it depends on you whether you want to invest or not but I mean if you invest in bitcoin you should be able to make the right decision if you want to benefit from bitcoin and otherwise you will lose your money when bitcoin price will decrease and if you investing in bitcoin in the long run you also have to have a strong belief and whether you have a big profit or not, the right conclusions you should think about",,,"September 30, 2017, 04:31:11 AM",Most of the people who heard about bitcoin for the first time thinks that it is a scam.

Although those who use and support bitcoin still make up a smaller percentage of the world's population, in the millennial generation of investors, the number of young people who turn away from traditional financial empires is growing. If this trend continues, it could mean an absolute collapse of the banking system, as it continues to adhere to outdated algorithms. Until now, there is some way, until even the most seasoned investors are completely free of traditional banking and monetary institutions, but today they can already control their future in terms of investments. Since it is easier for them to manage their own savings plan by investing and reinvesting new technologies. Although they continue to deduct a certain percentage of the usual pension fund, and their accounts still have to be paid through a bank account, but investments in crypto-currencies have become for them a central part of savings.A lot of investors who hold forth are the ones that we should be thankful for because they are the ones who held the market till what we have now.

There are many single children in orphanages, but poor countries continue to give too much birth instead of sheltering a homeless child.Already some of the nations such as China are having a strict one-child policy. And China has reaped the advantage of a low population growth during the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century. India also experimented with a strict one-child policy during the 1970s, but it was never implemented (after the death of its mastermind, Sanjay Gandhi).

Although those who use and support bitcoin still make up a smaller percentage of the world's population, in the millennial generation of investors, the number of young people who turn away from traditional financial empires is growing. If this trend continues, it could mean an absolute collapse of the banking system, as it continues to adhere to outdated algorithms. Until now, there is some way, until even the most seasoned investors are completely free of traditional banking and monetary institutions, but today they can already control their future in terms of investments. Since it is easier for them to manage their own savings plan by investing and reinvesting new technologies. Although they continue to deduct a certain percentage of the usual pension fund, and their accounts still have to be paid through a bank account, but investments in crypto-currencies have become for them a central part of savings.A lot of investors who would forth are the ones that we should be thankful for because they are the ones who held the market till what we have now. Imagine that they all dump as some new entrants are dumping, the word bitcoin wouldnt have worth much in today's world. Even though some people are quick to label them people who are greedy or want to make massive profit but I would disagree because a lot of them got bitcoin at a very cheap price and even if they all bolt at the point where price was touching $1000, they would have made a fortune out of the whole scenerio.Being an investor and a believer does not mean you have to own thousands but the resolution not to give in to challenges and fake news and the likes in the path to achieving greatness via bitcoin.We all aware of this.

Although those who use and support bitcoin still make up a smaller percentage of the world's population, in the millennial generation of investors, the number of young people who turn away from traditional financial empires is growing. If this trend continues, it could mean an absolute collapse of the banking system, as it continues to adhere to outdated algorithms. Until now, there is some way, until even the most seasoned investors are completely free of traditional banking and monetary institutions, but today they can already control their future in terms of investments. Since it is easier for them to manage their own savings plan by investing and reinvesting new technologies. Although they continue to deduct a certain percentage of the usual pension fund, and their accounts still have to be paid through a bank account, but investments in crypto-currencies have become for them a central part of savings.They simply wants to earn more profit since they know that after the backdrops, it will eventually increase again, referring to its market value. They are awared that it is normal for declines of its value to take place since it is volatile. What they do during the downfall of its price is to buy more Bitcoin and to hold despite of the decrease on its value.

An ICO is an event in which a new cryptocurrency project sells part of its cryptocurrency tokens to early adopters and enthusiasts in exchange for money today. ICOs provide a way for cryptocurrency project creators to raise money for their operations. Most ICOs raise money in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.The ICO usually takes place before the project is completed, and helps fund the expenses undertaken by the founding team until launch. For some of the larger projects, part of the ICO money goes into a foundation that provides ongoing support to the project. They also work as an initial distribution model for the cryptocurrency tokens, especially those with a proof of stake consensus algorithm.The ICO participants are invested in the success of the project. They can help get the word out and raise awareness in the broader community. They also provide early liquidity for the cryptocurrency tokens when they start trading. The ICO participants are also usually motivated by a profit potential if the project takes off and the tokens become worth more than the ICO price.ecome worth more than the ICO price.",,,,,,,"April 07, 2017, 06:34:24 AM","Why are you talking about systems?

But that's actually easier said than done.There's alot of ""ifs"" in your plan. You're just pretty much hoping that the markets move the way you would like it to.Quote When the price climb to $4100/btc, I sell my 0.184 btc to get my first capital and get $754.4 and 0.191 btc left .then when the price dump again to around $3900, I buy it again with my $754.4, so I get 0.193xxx btc and  my total btc is 0.384xx.Then what if the price dumped more after you bought at $3900? What would you do now? Panic sell? The bitcoin market isn't gonna hover around the $3900-$4100 price range forever. It could dump to $2500 next week, or rise to $5000, no one knows. Don't forget that crypto markets are super volatile. There are so much flaws I can see with this 'strategy'. But if you could make it work, then good. Best of luck.,yeah totally agree, its sounds good to me when you are actually at the right timing and always keeping an eye at the market price, but what if you cannot watch all the time? it is not that you are always sticking around in the corner and just watching the price, does it even sound boring or as what have he said what if the price suddenly goes down but you bought not at the lowest? you'll probably panic sell or much wiser if you hold it then wait til it pumps back.this has caught my attention, then how do you handle this situation? I know there are flaws, will you still hold? what if it totally down to the deepest dip? how do you handle it?Luckily, everything you say is still in the ""if"" circle, and I have not experienced it, I do not expect it that way. I know and you know, if the price goes down, then all we need to do is buy more or in bulk. Because bitcoin will always go back up. Am I right?.

At the end of the day, when everything fails, they start pointing fingers at everyone. ICO is never scam, the projects are. So do some serious digging before investing. That's very true.  People tend to FOMO buy in almost every ICO there is out there without doing any research on the project or even knowing the purpose of the coin or token.  Sometimes you might get lucky but it's not a wise decision in my book.There are dozens of ICOs that keep coming every time. I think the user must first do research on what ideas and advantages that dev deved to the audience because that's the important thing to determine the profit you'll get.

I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm.

When the price climb to $4100/btc, I sell my 0.184 btc to get my first capital and get $754.4 and 0.191 btc left .then when the price dump again to around $3900, I buy it again with my $754.4, so I get 0.193xxx btc and  my total btc is 0.384xx. With my $750 I can keep increase my bitcoin with this strategy. So what do you think. Am I doing right with my bitcoin? Or you have any advice. Please explain. Good strategy friend.

He wants to find as many to be His children as possible. It has nothing to do with the Church.The over-population threat is a lie. Look at Bangladesh and some India locations. Those people have very dense population per square mile. But they all live together in reasonable harmony. The earth can easily hold many more people.It is the wealthy, and their master, Satan, who are trying to reduce the population. They do it because Satan is the Destroyer.If the Earth EVER came close to being over-populated, God would step in and supply whatever was needed to keep the population growing.If I were God I would not want more people.  More headache, you have to listen to more prays, whining, begging, more work at the gates, hell etc.  You have worry about overpopulation in hell and heaven.

Why not we should focus on saving more bitcoins than selling our last remaining bitcoins?I read and hear from a lot of guys owning bitcoin saying, should I sell my bitcoins? The issues is, if you sell all your bitcoins when are you going to buy at lower price?There's no guarantee when exactly bitcoin price will surely come down.Share your thoughts about what you think guys. I must focus more on saving than selling my BTC because price is soaring up high and if ever price will go down we can only buy on that particular time most especially on its lowest dip as it start go up there will be a small chances that it will go back that dip again so much better to hold.

When the price climb to $4100/btc, I sell my 0.184 btc to get my first capital and get $754.4 and 0.191 btc left .then when the price dump again to around $3900, I buy it again with my $754.4, so I get 0.193xxx btc and  my total btc is 0.384xx. With my $750 I can keep increase my bitcoin with this strategy. So what do you think. Am I doing right with my bitcoin? Or you have any advice. Please explain.It is a very good strategy. More like trading and being extracareful with it. However, you should be very careful when doing this. So many times you may predict somethings and may never really be the way you want it. It is good you are only going to be using small amount to do this so as to minimise the risk. Also, it is best if you join some of these exchange sites but please don't put all you have there. Bittrex is a good one for example. This will help you to automatically keep tabs to the price even without monitoring it. With Bittrex, you can set your sell order at a price and buy order at the price you want. Just an advise though in case you do not know about it already. Best of luck.Also, like some people have said above me, altcoins are a very good way to increase your btc.

When the price climb to $4100/btc, I sell my 0.184 btc to get my first capital and get $754.4 and 0.191 btc left .then when the price dump again to around $3900, I buy it again with my $754.4, so I get 0.193xxx btc and  my total btc is 0.384xx. With my $750 I can keep increase my bitcoin with this strategy. So what do you think. Am I doing right with my bitcoin? Or you have any advice. Please explain.In bitcoin industry each and every one of us needs strategies for us to profit. We have different strategies on how to grow our bitcoin. Your strategy is like trading, you buy when it is on the drop price and you sell it when bitcoin price rise and that was how you grow your btc. All I say is you did it properly and that was right for me, you have confidence on how to deal with it at the same time you have a wise strategies. That's how some business man do.

Granted, China is a big contributor for the rise and adoption of Bitcoin and they are primarily the country involved with Bitcoin mining due to very cheap electricity cost. Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform. I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm. Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? In my own opinion, bitcoin will never die because of china because china is not the only country who uses bitcoin. Eventhough the price of bitcoin decreases when china started to ban bitcoin in their country, the price of bitcoin today is now recovering that's why bitcoin will not die because of china.","September 20, 2017, 04:46:35 AM","Quote from: Oliver A on September 19, 2017, 12:54:07 PMShould I Invest In Bitcoin?In my opinion, investing on bitcoin is one of the best thing you could do in your life.

The more you hold the bitcoin the more valuable it becomes.5. They gonna withdraw it in case of emergency.6. Back up money.7. For their families future expenses.8. For the future of the family.But this is just my opinion why they're holding their bitcoin. We do have different reasons why we're holding our bitcoin.According to me, the list has some reputation but all the points are valid. Holding on bitcoins for longer (even if the period is two months) will give more profits than selling out bitcoins at the present moment.

When the price climb to $4100/btc, I sell my 0.184 btc to get my first capital and get $754.4 and 0.191 btc left .then when the price dump again to around $3900, I buy it again with my $754.4, so I get 0.193xxx btc and  my total btc is 0.384xx. With my $750 I can keep increase my bitcoin with this strategy. So what do you think. Am I doing right with my bitcoin? Or you have any advice. Please explain.So far you have done well .

Considering OP's point that people would rather let someone starve to death than helping needy. The scammer manipulates very same people to give their money for easy money in return.  Committing a crime when someone is in dire need of money like family member is in life or death situation is different scenario. However when person  aspires lavish life without working honestly about it then that person starts scamming other people.

Despite of disapproval of  SEC to ETF for Bitcoin, it will still spread its market as time goes by. I do beleive, ETF would regret for disapporving Bitcoin since bitcoin has a huge potential. Bitcoin is our future major currency.The price is not all that linked with ETF, and now that it has been disapproved, it doesn't mean a we'd plunge into the depths of very low prices again. It's all part of a cycle, and as long as the demand is there, we'd be okay. That's the more important market fundamental.

When you ""wrap"" coins (send them into the exchange) they go into a intermediary wallet that is specifically assigned to your account. If the exchange were hacked, so to speak, it would require a compromise of the smart contract. It would take entirely too much time and resources to compromise each and every wallet holding funds. This is why ED is so ass draggingly slow; every thing you do either requires a signed message, or a pair of transactions  that will need to confirm at least once.did they get confidence scammed? or did ED get the best of them?

Right now the price of btc is higher so it is the best time to sell to get the profit.

One of the methods that people try is to scam and fool people who are a bit dumb or maybe the scammer is smarter to earn money. IF you are smart and manipulate people you may easily scam people and take theri money.. Overall it comes to conclusion that sometimes it becomes a need or it is lust that causes people to scam other people.I agree with you. Most of the people betray with the people because it is their nature. They want an easy way of making more and more money in a short time. Only to make money and to save their time while using innocent people for their work is often use by characterless people. They think that they have done a great job to flirt with the people but actually they are doing the wrong thing. These people do not have any respect in society.Right. People scams for their own sake without thinking other what will happen on their victim,  all they think is the money they could have due to their financial problems. They scam despite the fact that it is wrong to get money in easy and fas way. Beware  on the person you deal with.  Scammers are person who do not have conscience. ",,,,,,,,,,,,

I want to know is it true? or some kind of rumor? Anyone here who have faced such problem? Well in my own opinion, there are really many hackers these days so you need to be fully aware in your transactions. But always look in where you are typing because there are many fake websites that can steal your accounts in just one click, so always keep your eyes open or pilled.This. As a sig camp manager, you would be floored at the amount of folks on a weekly basis that have their ETH wallets compromised. In a group of 300 people, say at least 10% of those folks get hacked during the course of a 4 WEEK campaign; another 5% will change their wallet addresses due to ""possible insecurity'. This is why cryptos are so attractive to scammers/hackers; its just too easy at the moment given the high numbers of novice users. This is also why crypto isnt ready for the mainstream yet. There is a reason why ach is reversible, and that is that people tend to fuck up. Given how easy it is to fuck up in a very expensive way here, we will continue to be plagued by this until crypto becomes a lot more user friendly  would you care to explain how an eth wallet gets hacked in this context? im not trying to rail you on anything, just a legitimate question. it seems to me with each major altcoin, there is always a greater emphasis on security as it's expected that individuals new to crypto are entering the scene due to hearing about some new cryptocurrency. given those assumptions, it seems rather ridiculous that such a large percentage of wallets could be compromised on a regular basis. I dont know enough about the ethereum scene enough to formulate a possible reason, so if you could enlighten me, that'd be awesome.

When the price climb to $4100/btc, I sell my 0.184 btc to get my first capital and get $754.4 and 0.191 btc left .then when the price dump again to around $3900, I buy it again with my $754.4, so I get 0.193xxx btc and  my total btc is 0.384xx.

Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform. I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm. Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? Indeed. Of course bitcoin will not die just because China banned the bitcoin exchange in their country because China is just a part of the big community of bitcoin.

To clarify, they want to wait until the bitcoin price goes higher and higher so they can sell it with an expensive price, see? It is only about patience. I know that there is no guarantee that its price would rise, but some people are optimistic and only optimism wins. Until when will you hold your bitcoins then? Until it's price is ""expensive""? It's easy to say that, but if you don't mind, I would like to know how much is that ""expensive price"" for you? What if its price crashed all of a sudden or loses half of its value in less than a month? Will you still not sell? What I am trying to say is that the bitcoin price is too volatile and very unpredictable. All of us definitely have our own standard to determine wether the bitcoin price is valuable enough or not. Other people sell their bitcoins because its price is already big and profitable enough for them. They can always buy and hold again when the price goes down. This way they will profit even more.

That is the right thing to do if a person who have bitcoin or uses bitcoin then it is better for him to keep in long term and it is the best for almost all the bitcoin user because they can save time and money in that strategy which can give them a huge return after a few years of holding so even though you have job or not then holding bitcoin is a great strategy.","September 06, 2017, 07:13:48 PM",I would say in China as it is currently dominating the bitcoin market.

Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform. I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm. Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? Naaaaaa!!!

I don't get with why people was selfish. Yes ofcourse we share to others if we have but it is not that easy becuase what we have is not easy to get.What surprises me most is that if that energy and skills can be channeled into doing something productive, they can even do much better for themselves than trying to scam. At the same time, most of these guys are always just looking for the easy way out without conscience. However, they are not the only ones to be blamed, those who are greedy enough to fall for their voices are also to be blamed.Those are the people with the mind of to destroy other for themself. They never think of the people that if he can make someone fool and lot all of his wealth then what will be his position by losing all of his money by scam people.

Granted, China is a big contributor for the rise and adoption of Bitcoin and they are primarily the country involved with Bitcoin mining due to very cheap electricity cost. Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform. I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm. Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? Definitely not bitcoin doesn't rely or depends on the chinese investors. It is supported by lots of country around the world.

Base on OP, I don't see any direct point saying ""why people scam.""Anyway, the point of view of people who are not donating some money to people who are just begging is that those will become dependant instead of finding a job, a decent one, instead of just opening your hand while sitting in the streets waiting for someone to give them a coin.Those who deserve to receive donations are those who are facing health issues like cancer but they can't afford it, those who are working hard yet still it is not enough and etc.I agree with that, I like that it haha. I don't get with why people was selfish. Yes ofcourse we share to others if we have but it is not that easy becuase what we have is not easy to get.What surprises me most is that if that energy and skills can be channeled into doing something productive, they can even do much better for themselves than trying to scam. At the same time, most of these guys are always just looking for the easy way out without conscience. However, they are not the only ones to be blamed, those who are greedy enough to fall for their voices are also to be blamed.They say that you should teach a man to fish, and not give them the fish or else they won't learn and they'll just keep on asking for more. Of course, not everyone has the capability to work or earn money. It's sad how society works, how it deprives some people of the riches, and how unfair the world is. Even with the pre-historic age gone, it's still survival of the fittest. It's true, instead of just helping each other some would even step on those who are struggling or less fortunate. People scam because it's the fast and easy way to get money. Out of their desperation, they resort to these kind of decietful and fraudulent schemes. The people who scam should instead put their skills to legitimate work. ",,,,,,,,,,,,

Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform. I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm. Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? In my own opinion, it's a big no because china is not the center and not the reason why bitcoin is created that's why there is no need to panic if china started to ban bitcoin in their country even they are the reason why bitcoins price decreases in the past weeks and as of now bitcoins price is now recovering.","September 22, 2017, 09:34:25 AM","Quote from: Direwolve735 on September 22, 2017, 09:05:58 AMOf course, bitcoin has successfully passed several tests for viability.

Base on OP, I don't see any direct point saying ""why people scam.""Anyway, the point of view of people who are not donating some money to people who are just begging is that those will become dependant instead of finding a job, a decent one, instead of just opening your hand while sitting in the streets waiting for someone to give them a coin.Those who deserve to receive donations are those who are facing health issues like cancer but they can't afford it, those who are working hard yet still it is not enough and etc.I agree with that, I like that it haha. I don't get with why people was selfish. Yes ofcourse we share to others if we have but it is not that easy becuase what we have is not easy to get.What surprises me most is that if that energy and skills can be channeled into doing something productive, they can even do much better for themselves than trying to scam. At the same time, most of these guys are always just looking for the easy way out without conscience. However, they are not the only ones to be blamed, those who are greedy enough to fall for their voices are also to be blamed.They say that you should teach a man to fish, and not give them the fish or else they won't learn and they'll just keep on asking for more. Of course, not everyone has the capability to work or earn money. It's sad how society works, how it deprives some people of the riches, and how unfair the world is. Even with the pre-historic age gone, it's still survival of the fittest. It's true, instead of just helping each other some would even step on those who are struggling or less fortunate. People scam because it's the fast and easy way to get money. Out of their desperation, they resort to these kind of decietful and fraudulent schemes. The people who scam should instead put their skills to legitimate work. I agree with you people scam because they want or need money very fast and that is not possible so they try new ways to steal it you can do that with fake wallets or even hacking existing wallets.",,,,,,,,,,,,

What role do you think scarcity and greed play in all this? First and foremost, I won't say most of us are pretty simple. The truth is that one can just speak for himself/herself cause you have no idea what runs through the other person's mind. Life itself isn't meant to be complicated. Sure, life though bring it's own challenges but men added to those challenges in a way and out of greed made it so complicated.Let me use some countries as an example. This countries are extremely rich with natural resources (from the smallest natural resource to the biggest one you can think of) but still, life is extremely complicated for most of the citizens except for some leaders who believe in making just themselves extremely rich like they aren't gonna die. Life already gave them everything to make it easy for everyone, but the greed found in human made it a hell hole.If we choose to live without complications, we definitely can but who knows maybe the heart of men has been predefaulted to be desperately wicked or we just imbibed the wickedness from only God knows where.","March 25, 2017, 01:24:24 PM","Quote from: CEJ on March 07, 2017, 06:52:52 AMNowadays many people are starting to invest money on bitcoin or the buy bitcoin..is this a good approach?How this will influence us in future?It depends on a person, if he is good on managing his money, then investing some of his money to bitcoin is a good idea. This is a good approach because it is a long term investment which you could get profits in the long run, and compare if you are going to invest your money in the bank, investing your money in bitcoin is more profitable for me, because the price is always fluctuating, and every time it fluctuates, it gets higher and higher.Though right now, we are having a huge price drop because of this Hard Fork drama, but I know that this is just for temporary, and I'm not going to do panic sell like some of us are doing because of being afraid that bitcoins price might get even smaller.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"July 30, 2017, 08:56:56 AM","Quote from: jaki10 on July 30, 2017, 08:12:00 AMWhen you ask for a solution it has different ways but people may dislike or like it.

Granted, China is a big contributor for the rise and adoption of Bitcoin and they are primarily the country involved with Bitcoin mining due to very cheap electricity cost. Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform. I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm. Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? I agree that Bitcoin won't die just because China banned Bitcoin exchanges. It is indeed a major loss for Bitcoin because it resulted to major dumps. But Bitcoin can still have a positive future without it. Bitcoin still have a large community without China that will give Bitcoin a high market demand that still makes its market value high. And now, we are seeing that Bitcoin is slowly climbing its way up, hoping that it will continue until it's back to its feet again.","September 22, 2017, 10:14:22 AM","it depends on the bitcoin trust, if you believe invest bitcoin then please invest using bitcoin, if not believe do not have to invest using bitcoin ....",,,"October 07, 2017, 03:28:00 AM","People's impression once they heard about bitcoin is that, it is something that can be used only for online gambling and mostly associated with the word SCAM.

I don't get with why people was selfish. Yes ofcourse we share to others if we have but it is not that easy becuase what we have is not easy to get.What surprises me most is that if that energy and skills can be channeled into doing something productive, they can even do much better for themselves than trying to scam.

Of course, not everyone has the capability to work or earn money. It's sad how society works, how it deprives some people of the riches, and how unfair the world is. Even with the pre-historic age gone, it's still survival of the fittest. It's true, instead of just helping each other some would even step on those who are struggling or less fortunate. People scam because it's the fast and easy way to get money. Out of their desperation, they resort to these kind of decietful and fraudulent schemes. The people who scam should instead put their skills to legitimate work. I agree with you people scam because they want or need money very fast and that is not possible so they try new ways to steal it you can do that with fake wallets or even hacking existing wallets.i guess this guy maybe is not reading the whole thing. i am also tired hearing reasons since before that its because of poverty, then how will you explain those people that struggle from zero to a hundred without doing something stupid like being selfish and arrogant? it doesn't makes sense right? they just want easy money, those lazy people that wants to earn without applying work much likely those you called "" scammers"" loses its money also so easily.",,,,,,,,,,,,

One is through taking no action whatsoever, let nature inhumanely take its action through wars, poverty and famine. That way the population will drastically deplete though no human would agree in such a thing but that's why there's a second option which is through humane acts. Taking action by educating the people about the matter, giving out birth control and so much more.I agree with this. So the solution now is here. It just depends on you whether you take an action or not. If you're concerned regarding this issue then you must take action so that others will do. If not, then don't do anything.

It could be through a simple and cheap, but yet very effective paper wallet storage. It could be you just storing your digital wallet files on USB drives, and you can choose to go for a hardware wallet.

I'm used to using healthy cash flow where if I earn a lot then I also have the right to spend a lot too, it's very relative and I split the two earnings where the trade included in the cash flow, and the purchase of Ico coins to be traded regularly and kept all the time .",,,,,,,"September 22, 2017, 01:08:34 PM","It seems that there is an increasing number of people globally, keenly interested in cryptocurrency.

Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform. I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm. Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? I doubt that Bitcoin will die just because  China banned Bitcoin exchanges together with ICOs. But indeed, it affected Bitcoin and other cryptos negatively. The cryptomarket fell because of what happened. But we are now seeing that Bitcoin is slowly making its way back and that's something to look forward to.

This era of bitcoin had passed, train had already left for the free riders.  Unless you have a huge fund, you can never be rich with Bitcoin if you are only to hold it and wait and your initial capital is not that big.  We need to take advantage of the altcoin market.  there are several parked trains in there but we must be careful because we do not know where those train will go.  So we need to research these altcoins and hopefully we can pick the one going beyond the moon.Yes altcoin market is looking very promising at a moment and price is pumping like anything so even if you manage to invest in a right coin at this stage then you can make huge profits in coming days but making profits from altcoin is a short term process and if you want to earn good profits in long term then bitcoin is the answer to your question.I agree! Though altcoins now are pumping high and some are panic buying and some are investing on different coins so they could make a profit out of it. But nothing beats bitcoin which is still the best and top of all coins, I'd rather invest on bitcoins more than the other altcoins, though ETH and Dash looks promising nowadays.I am not sure how dash will perform in future but ETH and XMR are long term players so if you invest in those coins then you are in safe hands as they will surely touch new heights in future so if you want to make good profits from it then you should have patience of holding them for a long term.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"August 08, 2017, 01:17:25 AM","Quote from: af_newbie on July 19, 2017, 03:17:33 PMQuote from: jojowar on July 19, 2017, 03:05:08 PMWhat is the best solution to resolve our problem in overpopulation?1.

What a big change! Yes, global warming is real.Even in my place, the summers have become very intolerant now. Back in my hometown in Nepal, even in the hills it is getting really warm during the summers. A few years back, there was no need of an air-conditioner in the hills. But now in the summers you can't survive without one. Do you even know what ""climate change"" is? Climate is defined as decadal change, ten years. At least three periods of ten years are required in terms of data, to comment on change in climate. Year to year weather that you don't like or find unpleasant is not climate change.Numerous climate patterns run in long cycles such as 60-80 years. The effects of these are often misunderstood as being caused by man. An example is the PDO, or Pacific Decadal Oscillation.Numerous regional changes are mistakenly attributed to man's CO2 production. For example, in Nepal you have glaciers melting.

Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform. I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm. Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? Bitcoin will not die,but there will be a lot of obstacles to be faced not only by bitcoin but by us as well,because china's contribution so damn high.

One dillema is the  demand and consumption of the population that is actually increasing but the provisions/ supplies are quite running out and we are having a hard time keeping up with it. With this alone, it is best to control the number of birth or children in the family. One way of doing this is for the male to undergo vasectomy or the female to under ligation. This is so since sex is a natural activity for us humans and no matter what we do, there will always be a point where we give in to such desires so it is quite an impossible thing to tell people to stop doing it. Another is to implement the use of some contraceptives to prevent unwanted/unplanned pregnancies. In line with this, we should also educate the people regarding sex, family planning, and the effects of overpopulation so they will understand the reasons why there is a need to control it.

Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform. I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm. Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? This is the funniest thing I've ever read in this forum, How come that China can able to kill or destroy bitcoin? that's not possible instead it's impossible actually. its not because they owned the highest averages of bitcoin mining and they ban the ico to their country, bitcoin will gonna die because of what they did.

I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm.

Bitcoin miners process and verify bitcoin transactions through mathematical algorithms based on cryptographic hash algorithms (hence the name cryptocurrency) SHA256   Bitcoin is decentralizedThere is no central authority that controls Bitcoin or its network of transactions. The miner community Bitcoin network, processing transactions. If any changes are made to Bitcoin by developers or developers using GitHub, a majority of 51% of the miners must approve it. This ensures that, in theory, no individual can steal a bitcoin or print (create) ","September 21, 2017, 05:26:53 PM",obviously Not. Not only I know but also every know that it will not be happened.

Granted, China is a big contributor for the rise and adoption of Bitcoin and they are primarily the country involved with Bitcoin mining due to very cheap electricity cost. Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform. I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm. Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? I think it is impossible because we all know that bitcoin in china isn't a big thing because even if in the past few days they banned and stop different transactions in bitcoin today I think the problem was overcome and resolve. And we all know that bitcoin is a very strong kind of digital currency. It will be a big thing in the future. Of course you are right because a few days back Chinese government has imposed a ban on bitcoin just to control its price which resulted in the very low price of bit coins.

If mining and network operations were banned in China it would hit bitcoin HARD. The biggest issue is for miners to get their money out - they're mining for bitcoin without an exchange to cash out. I mean, they will find a way, it won't be THAT hard, especially for the more tech orientated, but I assume whatever they'll be doing will be technically considered illegal?

It is very recommended for investors to distribute at least 10-20% of their portfolio's investment to Bitcoins.The recent swings in Bitcoin price has shown that it has great potential to rise. When one gonna see yearly change, Bitcoin is non-stoppable since 2014, with yearly change from 30-100%.So if anyone is surfboard investor, Bitcoin is best holding to go with atm and to make some good profits.That is why I think it is best to really invest in bitcoin there are profit in saving up in it and there are profit in trading with it, I think other Altcoins really want to be like bitcoin for sure because of what bitcoin has attain for it self, I am using it now in paying my expenses and keep my internet up getting some advantage in your daily need with bitcoin is pretty much helpful for me. yes that is right, i will always like to invest my money in bitcoin as the price of bitcoin is increasing continously  therefore i will like to invest more and more in bitcoin. Don't be greedy in investing in bitcoin because if you are greedy and you don't do analysis then there is a high possibility for you to lose money because sometimes the price of bitcoin is falling down because of some bad news or progress. If you want to invest in bitcoin more and more, then you should analyze first what is going on and if it is a good time to buy bitcoin or not. Don't be greedy, control your emotions.I don't see anything wrong in investing in bitcoins as price has always increased in long run so if you can hold them for a long term then there is nothing wrong in investing in it but make sure that you also sell them when price is allowing you to make profits.me either because if we are trying to investing now and we are in stuck in high price, then we don't have to sell to make profit but we can use it to do trading bitcoin-altcoin, so i think our profit is from altcoin and we can increase our bitcoin for more. beside that, if we watch from time to time, bitcoin price is always in the high price in the end so i think its still worth if we are investing for now and save it in our wallet.Yeah and bitcoin is an promising investment to make as price has kept on increasing in recent times and it will keeping on moving in positive direction as there will be many new investors who will invest their money in bitcoins which will take price to next level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"August 12, 2017, 10:00:46 AM",Overpopulation is really hard to prevent but on my opinion the best solutions are giving free contraceptives to avoid pregnancy or the government should make a law that is allowing a family to only have 2 children.  ,,,"September 22, 2017, 05:39:20 PM",  my friend just got hacked. just by he use a chrome extension.

Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform. I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm. Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? Replace Bitcoin with ""X"" if China suddenly went out of its way to ban cars, or the internet, or anything - will it die. I don't think so. Because china has such a large percentage of the worlds population, and is such an economic powerhouse, it certainly won't help much, but BTC will cary on.

But when investors see the nega effect that China can make on bitcoin price, their passion may fall for fear of other countries doing the same. Perhaps this year is a year of ice and fire for bitcoin and winter is coming.The life of Bitcoin doesn't solely depend on china and that's why it is decentralized. I know china has a bigger stake in terms of mining power and investment but that doesn't mean if they decide to leave the network others won't replace them and so I don't think Bitcoin will ever die because of the Chinese and their drama.Yes, that is definitely true. Bitcoin will never die just because a country leave the game and even china that is one of the earliest country that cope bitcoin, it doesn't have a strong effect on the price because even they leave bitcoin, the price of bitcoin is still going up and the other countries and people are still supporting bitcoin no matter what happen.","September 25, 2017, 09:20:26 AM",Why not?

Actually everyone could easily handle bitcoin than gold. Also the main reason is that people trust on it, and our trust built it.  Bitcoin has built from the algo, and that makes easy to manage the bitcoin itself. The gold as a real commodity and it makes hard to manage the gold itself. You can't save them anywhere.That's included on the advantages by bitcoin itself.  In this day more people are believing on the bitcoin and the demand increase. Exactly, and the demand raises the price a lot in the bitcoin case.We have only 21 million coins, what is very good thing in particular, because you cannot increase a supply like fiat or gold ( by mining it ).Also, bitcoin is easy to transfer and pretty much worldwide, when fiat is only available to transfer somewhere else by banking system or cash ( which is a dangerous option ).Gold, is also very hard to transport, and you dont have this problem in cryptocurrency world.We only need more and more people joining us in bitcoin to even make demand higher, and to make bitcoin more trusted across the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"August 15, 2017, 04:59:07 AM","Quote from: winterland on August 14, 2017, 11:29:17 PMQuote from: Sithara007 on August 13, 2017, 04:54:07 AMQuote from: winterland on August 12, 2017, 09:01:39 PMQuote from: jojowar on July 19, 2017, 03:05:08 PMWhat is the best solution to resolve our problem in overpopulation?Overpopulation may seem like a big problem but I think the biggest problem is misallocation of resources and how wasteful we have become, people throw away perfectly working phones just because a new one is available, we have become very wasteful and if that was not the case the current population of the world will not be a problem.So according to you, there should be equality in wealth around the world. That's not going to work. So there will be a disparity in the wealth levels of the people, as long as human race exists in this planet.

I hate communism, what I mean is just look at all the money people spend on useless stuff, if people did not do that, then that useless stuff will not exist on the first place and the rate at which we destroy the planet will be far less and with that the current population will not be a problem.How much of our food is wasted?

I have a feeling that in the near future that there will be a new horrifying rule to reduce our overpopulation. I know its ridiculous but when I think about it I know that some wealthy people or secret organization will be forced to do that when they feel that the food or natural resources aren't sufficient enough to supply us all.Currently, the natural resources around the world are not enough to feed 7.5 billion people. That's why we have poverty and starvation all around us. And the worst part is that even now, the human population is growing by close to 2% per year. True, and to add something up, the land is not sufficient to hold any farms to feed us all with technology advancing on the other side - if the population still increases in the near future. There would be less space to build farms because of the technology advancing. Many lands will be useless, many tress will be cut, and many mines will corrupt the earth/soil, resulting to worsening of global warming effects. So the best solution for us now is family planning, because we cannot tell a person that they should only have one child if they prefer having a big family. We all should raise awareness to all of the people the effect of over population resulting to Earth being congested by us.

If I think about huge profits, it has to be something close to $10,000 as minimum. If it's just a few hundred bucks you're talking about, then it's just an okay profit. Despite the fact that the price has gone up like +400%, which can be seen as a huge return in terms of percentages, but not the actual profit nominated in fiat.

Granted, China is a big contributor for the rise and adoption of Bitcoin and they are primarily the country involved with Bitcoin mining due to very cheap electricity cost. Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform.

Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? The answer is NO. But when investors see the nega effect that China can make on bitcoin price, their passion may fall for fear of other countries doing the same. Perhaps this year is a year of ice and fire for bitcoin and winter is coming.The life of Bitcoin doesn't solely depend on china and that's why it is decentralized. I know china has a bigger stake in terms of mining power and investment but that doesn't mean if they decide to leave the network others won't replace them and so I don't think Bitcoin will ever die because of the Chinese and their drama.Nope, China had gave up their powerful in Bitcoin, ban the ICO market and cryptocurrency exchange proves them cannot keep it.

Only lazy people finding it too difficult and frustrating one.The thing about bitcoin is that requires you to give it patience and time and it will give you back profits in return, and when it comes to trading you need to study and learn the basics before investing your money rather than simply losing it, so take the time to learn more about trading bitcoin and try virtual trading and start low and eventually you will be get perfectly ready to start trading and get profit from it. it was a good opinion, I agree, before we do anything, we have to learn it before, when you learn, you have to be patient, diligent, and do not easily give up, then you will find the advantages, I think the people who joined the bitcoin, especially people who are new to Bitcoin, they are too focused to getting money without knowing what it is bitcoin, and it's true, if you make an investment without having a strategy and the proper way, of course you will lose money, so, learn first before investing bitcoin, starting from something small and it will continue to be great. whatever we do, we must know how to do it...

Lot of people are shifting from gold to Bitcoin in the field of trading who are aware of crypto currency or Bitcoin. Gold is not much increasing its price through the few years and it's price is almost stable and we have seen through the last 5 year Bitcoin price increases upto huge amount so I think investing in it is much more better than gold.As with any commodity, including Gold, bitcoin is subject to drastic price fluctuations.

Granted, China is a big contributor for the rise and adoption of Bitcoin and they are primarily the country involved with Bitcoin mining due to very cheap electricity cost. Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform. I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm. Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? The answer is NO. But when investors see the nega effect that China can make on bitcoin price, their passion may fall for fear of other countries doing the same. Perhaps this year is a year of ice and fire for bitcoin and winter is coming.The life of Bitcoin doesn't solely depend on china and that's why it is decentralized. I know china has a bigger stake in terms of mining power and investment but that doesn't mean if they decide to leave the network others won't replace them and so I don't think Bitcoin will ever die because of the Chinese and their drama.Yes, u r right. Bitcoin is boundless, but its price is not. When u go back to 2013, the first time that China banned bitcoin, the price went down from 1000 to 500 or less and last for nearly three years.

Government can't stop population growth, all they can do is to let the people be aware of the effect of having a lot of children.I agree, government can not forcibly implement a law that suggest to have only one child, two child, and etc. The government can only do is to inform educate and give give aid to those families. The problem of over population basically originated from partners that are always having ""thing"" with out limitation. They do it for pleasure and didn't always think what possibly could go wrong. Overpopulation can be slowed by having ""thing"" using preventives, and by not letting the ""another thing that comes out of males"" go and enter in the ""third thing of the female"". They have the pleasure and for sure the female will not be pregnant. With overpopulation arises another problems which are, scarcity of limited resources and poverty.theres a lot of solution we can implied in controlling the big population in our country. First the government need to have a policy that every family has a limitid children can have, and by giving knowledge to those who are in the poor stages what will happen if they have a lot of children.  They need to educate people about what is the effect of having a big family.",,,,,"September 06, 2017, 02:10:52 PM",Yes.

Granted, China is a big contributor for the rise and adoption of Bitcoin and they are primarily the country involved with Bitcoin mining due to very cheap electricity cost. Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform. I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm. Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? No! Probably not. I don't think Bitcoin will die just because of one country that implemented banning of Bitcoins. Bitcoin will still skyrocket without China though it plays a big role in the market but I am not convinced about the concern of death of Bitcoin when one or even five countries ban Bitcoin totally. It might be their biggest mistake of cracking down those crypto exchanges instead of regulating them as the government will still collect tax on it. These countries will soon realize that they have a wrong move towards modern digital investments. They're just wasting peoples opportunity to invest in cryptocurrency.

PHOTOGRAPH BY GORDON WILTSIEIn recent years, global warming has been the subject of a great deal of political controversy. As scientific knowledge has grown, this debate is moving away from whether humans are causing warming and toward questions of how best to respond.Signs that the Earth is warming are recorded all over the globe. The easiest way to see increasing temperatures is through the thermometer records kept over the past century and a half. Around the world, the Earth's average temperature has risen more than 1 degree Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius) over the last century, and about twice that in parts of the Arctic.GLOBAL LAND-OCEAN TEMPERATURE INDEXCHART COURTESY NASA/GISSThis doesn<U+0092>t mean that temperatures haven't fluctuated among regions of the globe or between seasons and times of day. But if you average out the temperature all over the world over the course of a year, you see that temperatures have been creeping upward.HOW IS CLIMATE CHANGE MEASURED?Although we can't look at thermometers going back thousands of years, we do have some records that help us figure out what temperatures and concentrations were like in the distant past. For example, trees store information about the climate in the place where they live. Each year, trees grow thicker and form new rings. In warmer and wetter years, the rings are thicker. Old trees and wood can tell us about conditions hundreds or even several thousands of years ago.Those i got from National Geographic, so please take care our world for Next Generation.How to take care our earth? Like don't use any device can upward our climate just like Air Conditioner has Freon Gas.As i knew old Air Conditioner use R22 now change to R32 and R410 more Enviroment Friendly.I think arround the world has use Ozone Free devices to take care our earth atmostphere.",,,Today at 04:52:29 PM,"I envy you.

The Science Team of the Canadian Research Icebreaker CCGS Amundsen had to call it quits on the first leg of its 2017 Expedition because of hazardous, southward-moving Arctic sea ice that would have put the ships at their destination far too late to meet their research objectives.According to an announcement made by the University of Manitoba, the extreme ice conditions were definitively <U+0093>caused by climate change,<U+0094> though the school offers no insights or proof explaining why.

The least demanding approach to see expanding temperatures is through the thermometer records kept over the previous century and a half. Around the globe, the Earth's normal temperature has risen more than 1 degree Fahrenheit in the course of the most recent century, and about twice that in parts of the Arctic. I figure yes, we can see each day these changes in Europe the temperature might be more than 50 Celsius. That is a terrifying news or information. Ice on Arctic melts, some creature and plant species disappear, all of these things can show a dangerous atmospheric deviation.I don't see it like that at all.

Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? A big NO from me too. Although admittedly they've made impact in btc and caused a big leap in the price they are still one country. There's always another country who will take their place that's why they can't kill btc. And as long as we are here supporting and holding our btc tightly, no one can ever kill btc. The only thing that I think btc will die is if a sole entity purchased every single btc there is. We all know that's not possible so to put it simply, there is no way a single country can put an end to btc.I'm more than confident that China can replace China in Japan and perform all those functions very well. And there is a version that after the party meeting of the Chinese government, the whole situation can greatly improve in a positive way.

Good long-term prospects for the Crypto-currency, giving every reason to believe that such investments will bring good profit for a long time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Granted, China is a big contributor for the rise and adoption of Bitcoin and they are primarily the country involved with Bitcoin mining due to very cheap electricity cost. Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform. I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm. Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? Yes I do really agree with you. It is practically not right that because of China's loss in the bitcoin community because what they have done on banning bitcoin exchanges in their country, we can now conclude that bitcoin will die. No it is really not just like that because China was just only a part of the big bitcoin community even though they are a big loss in the community because a lot of big potential investors can be located on China, still it does not imply that because they are gone, bitcoin will die. Remember, there is still a big percentage of bitcoin users in the world that was enough or more than enough to keep bitcoin going.","October 05, 2017, 02:24:44 AM",Of course I will definitely invest in bitcoin. investing the best way to get big profits.investment to train our patience.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now it needs to be seen how the extinction of these glaciers are going to affect the fresh water flows in these regions. Already evidence has come to support the claim that many of the rivers are witnessing a decrease in their volumes. I'm not quite following that. If a glacier shrinks, in the short run that increases ground water, which should cause a rise in rivers. In the longer run, is there a decrease in river volume?The hydrologic cycle describes how water evaporates, then is deposited as rain or snow, then moves downhill to streams and rivers and eventually to oceans then to evaporate again.Generally, the only way for a decrease in river volume to occur would seem to be for an area to have lower humidity in the air.Sure, there could be some localized areas basically to the sides of glaciers that would have water flow affected by the shrinking (or expanding) of a glacier.

Granted, China is a big contributor for the rise and adoption of Bitcoin and they are primarily the country involved with Bitcoin mining due to very cheap electricity cost. Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform. I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm. Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? Yes, there is still a very optimistic future even without China. Remember that Japan embrace bitcoin with open hands. China is just one country in Asia. Bitcoin is also very popular in in neighbor countries like Taiwan, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia Indonesia and many other countries in Asia. You should also consider  European countries, South and North Africa , Middle East, North and South America. China may have an impact on the price today,  but it will just become history later on.

This melting includes mountain glaciers, ice sheets covering Western Antarctica and Greenland, as well as Arctic sea ice.Many species have been affected by rising temperatures. For example, a researcher named Bill Fraser, has tracked down Adelie's penguin population in Antarctica, whose number has shrunk from 32,000 pairs to 11,000 in 30 years.Sea levels have risen more rapidly over the last century.Some species of butterflies, foxes and alpine plants have moved further north or to higher and cold regions.Precipitation (rain and snow) has risen on average worldwide.Some invasive species are growing rapidly.

There is easily enough space, materials, capability to produce food and water, and everything we need on earth for 100 billion people.Perhaps people in Bangladesh are not as happy as they could be. They might be the nation with the least amount of land per person in the world. But even in their dense population, they are living and making it. Now, it is true that I like the open highways of western America. And if Siberia and Northern Canada were habitable, there is lots of room to make highways to travel. But, the land could handle population density like Bangladesh if the people worked together to make it happen.If the two things that I mentioned - Seasteading and aquaponics - were properly applied and used, the whole ocean is there for us to populate on the top of it. And this says nothing about if we grow downward on both sea and land.On top of this, if the correct form of global warming were made to happen, the Sahara would become a garden, the cold lands of Siberia and Northern Canada would become warm enough to be inhabited, life on the rest of the land could become a beach, the greater warmth could grow lots more agricultural products, there would still be cold climate in the high mountains for people who liked to live in cold, Antarctica might remain cold, but warm enough to live on...So you see? The possibilities for way more population on earth are essentially far greater than anything that we have now.One of the greatest needs for mote population is so that we get more intelligent people who can figure out the science to make the kinds of spacecraft that it takes to go to the stars, and start populating the universe.The ability to go to the stars in far shorter time than rockets could take us there, was developed way back in the 1950s and early 1960s. This is not a dream. This is reality. Check http://newatlas.com/orion-project-atom-bomb-spaceship/49454/. The only thing we need is a few more intelligent scientists to clean up the few loose ends in the program. We need more population to get these scientists.Most of the time, the average citizen does not want war or fighting outside of sports competition. It's the leaders who want war. The problem of over-population is a lie. It is brainwashing by the leaders to gain control over everybody for their own ends. War is of their making, not of the general population.",,,,,"September 19, 2017, 09:32:17 AM","Quote from: Spendulus on September 19, 2017, 04:02:49 AMQuote from: edmond_dantes on September 18, 2017, 11:20:58 PMI don't know very much about it but there are a lot of hurricanes happening all at once I have some news for you (and I live in an area these storms affect).Hurricanes are normal weather.

If they refuse, they should be arrested and undergo forced sterilization and pay for it. 3.  Tax incentives, no income or sale tax, free housing for those who undergo permanent sterilization voluntarily before having children.It is a hard problem to solve because any modification to human behavior go against our natural survival instincts.I think that sterilization is a great step toward reducing the population.

If they melt, then there will be an increase in the sea level by many meters. Global warming is the sudden increase of our earth's temperature. Global warming is really happening in our world now in fact it is getting many negative effect. One proof that global warming is really happening is when we observed that even it is rainy season, we can feel hot temperature in our surrounding. If this continue, there is a possibility that the arctic region can melt so many low lying areas may disappear. Global warming, along with the cutting and burning of forests and other critical habitats, is causing the loss of living species.There is no sea level rise when things that are floating melt.If ice on land melts and the water runs into the ocean, that will cause a slight sea level rise.

Granted, China is a big contributor for the rise and adoption of Bitcoin and they are primarily the country involved with Bitcoin mining due to very cheap electricity cost. Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform. I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm. Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? I agree in this argument. Yes for sure it will affect the Bitcoin performance in a negative way. But that does not mean that Bitcoin will die. In my opinion, Bitcoin will drop to lower price again way the same as 5 years ago. However, this is an opportunity to invest again in Bitcoin at lower price and there is a big chance for the price to come back or even higher than today.What will greatly  affect affect Bitcoin than China is the Korea because there are rumors that the government is planning to ban Bitcoin.","October 07, 2017, 09:43:58 AM",It is best to invest in bitcoins as it a good form of investment and can be considered as an asset which keeps growing so its better to choose this as a kind of long term investment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By June 2018 it can easily be in the $7400's USD, based on the current trends!   However, if you live in America, then you never know which day they are going to either take your coins and freeze them and make you turn on your webcam and who knows what on American exchanges versus the Americans might end up lucking out, but still might want to look for NON-AMERICAN EXCHANGES to play it safe.You can view some of my Bitcoin Trend Analysis on the future (only based on current trends though not civil wars) at my crypto economics URL below:https://bennn.io/AR/economics-night.htmlor you can monitor my top picks here:https://bennn.io/AR/krypt0-k0mp4r3-d4shb04rd.htmlHowever, it all depends on who starts the civil war first and how poor people are willing to get before starting the civil war.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"September 19, 2017, 03:35:16 PM","Quote from: BADecker on September 15, 2017, 01:45:28 PMQuote from: inoymuninoy on September 15, 2017, 12:38:22 PMFamily planning is the best optionI agree.

I am a guilty of contributing to this nonsense but the bonuses offered really make a difference in their games.   My Question: Does the posting of one's referral link to a specific thread in which the sole purpose of that thread's creation was for the posting of one's referral                 link hurt one's member status, ranking, or overall reputation as a serious member of the community?  If you think about posting a referal link, I will find you and I will delete you. your kidding right? Have you seen the yabtcl thread. There are thousands. I have never posted a referral link outside of yabtcl's thread. Why not answer my question instead of threaten. As a staff member I would expect you to at least read my post. Unless you have a bot that tracks down any occurrence of the words ""referral"" or ""link"" and then stack them with your super powered staff threats.I never said I was going to create atopic myself.

Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform. I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm. Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? Yes. Bitcoin is on a global scale and China is just a part of it. Though China is one contributor to bitcoin industry, Bitcoin can still go on in its path. There are many people who will continue to supoort bitcoin because it is a coin worth supporting.

The energy to melt all that ice in 100 years must come from air.High school physics allows us to calculate what amount of energy it would take to melt Greenland in 100 years, and what temperature the air would have to be for this to happen. The worst projections of increased air temperatures from ""global warming,"" which have been falsified, involved a warming of 5-8F.  That would not have the effect on Greenland that you have asserted because of it's altitude and location.Believe me, it's not going to happen.On a longer timeframe, you must admit the certainty of another ice age.

Educating the masses helps them understand the need to have one or two children at the most. Similarly, education plays a vital role in understanding latest technologies like CloudDesktopOnline that are making huge waves in the world of computing. Families that are facing a hard life and choose to have four or five children should be discouraged. Family planning and efficient birth control can help in women making their own reproductive choices. Open dialogue on abortion and voluntary sterilization should be seen when talking about overpopulation.Making People Aware of Family Planning: As population of this world is growing at a rapid pace, raising awareness among people regarding family planning and letting them know about serious after effects of overpopulation can help curb population growth. One of the best way is to let them know about various safe sex techniques and contraceptives methods available to avoid any unwanted pregnancy.Tax Benefits or Concessions: Government of various countries might have to come with various policies related to tax exemptions to curb overpopulation. One of them might be to waive of certain part of income tax or lowering rates of income tax for those married couples who have single or two children. As we humans are more inclined towards money, this may produce some positive results.Knowledge of Sex Education: Imparting sex education to young kids at elementary level should be must. Most parents feel shy in discussing such things with their kids which result in their children going out and look out for such information on internet or discuss it with their peers. Mostly, the information is incomplete which results in sexually active teenagers unaware of contraceptives and embarrassed to seek information about same. It is therefore important for parents and teachers to shed their old inhibitions and make their kids or students aware of solid sex education.",,,,,"October 08, 2017, 11:35:45 PM","I think Yes because we already feel it ,just like the weather .",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"October 04, 2017, 03:19:01 AM","although China has an important role for bitcoin, I think bitcoin will not die without China.

You can split money from your profit and re-invest to Bitcoin again, it does not makes you loss your capital.I did not meant it in that way, if you buy a stock of Microsoft then it is very likely that stock is going to have a bigger value than the price you bought it in the next 10 years, so you can basically hold it and forget about it, bitcoin is a great investment too, but I do not think I will be able to stop looking at the markets the same way I could do with a Microsoft stock.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"September 27, 2017, 05:32:58 PM","Population is group or number of people in the community, bunch of people in the society",,,,,"October 09, 2017, 06:18:21 PM",yes it is real made  in Africa you will see,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"October 05, 2017, 08:29:34 AM","China's banned BTC and all cryptocurrencies may be temporary, to appease international agencies and hardcore communist members ahead of the upcoming Communist Party conventionChina's big government and banks cannot tolerate Bitcoin.

It is possible for a sparsely populated area to become densely populated if it is not able to sustain life. Growing advances in technology with each coming year has affected humanity in many ways.

You can earn big profit in bitcoin just don't invest your all money. Bitcoin is very important to all because its help to them to reach their dream in life.It's easy to say we can earn big profit but in reality we sometimes panic when the price dump, this is a game for the risk takersand for you to have big profits you need to invest big and must be strong in holding your bitcoins as there will be a lot of trials you will face.The best way to avoid that is to not have your bitcoin in an exchange and to have it stored in a way that is not easy to access that way when you see a small decrease in the price even if you panic you are going to think of all the things you need to do to get that bitcoin and then you are going to give up and keep holing.Investing in bitcoin is far better than any other business or keeping your money in your local bank account. Because bitcoin will give us more and more profit than any other regular or online business. It will definitely change our future.

While the countries who have already face this problem also need to provide proper solution like to educate the people about overpopulation problem and their results.It is already a big issue and in the future, it is likely to worsen further. And the biggest problem is that the overpopulation problem is most severe in the densely-populated countries. Take the example of countries such as Egypt and Bangladesh.

Granted, China is a big contributor for the rise and adoption of Bitcoin and they are primarily the country involved with Bitcoin mining due to very cheap electricity cost. Now, the Chinese government has its own agenda and I think in the long run Bitcoin can be running against those agenda so they are now thinking of slowly disengaging and disconnecting their citizens away from the cryptocurrency platform. I know that whatever China will decide on the impact can be heavy on the market and this is shown with the recent decision banning the ICO projects and the unconfirmed total ban of Bitcoin exchanges though it is still a rumor and nobody would want to confirm. Can cryptocurrency still go on and have a very optimistic future even without China as part of the equation? Actually, Bitcoin will not die just because of China's banning of bitcoin exchange in their country. Yes there is really an instance that the action that has been done by China do have a negative effect on the bitcoin's price rate, still it is not enough to state that because of China's loss bitcoin will die. Because China was just a part of the big bitcoin community so still there will be a large percentage of users that can support bitcoin to continuously operate so that there is no possibility for bitcoin to die just because of China's loss.Yes, definitely. I agree with you mate. Bitcoin will not die just because of China. As China bitcoin holders dump their bitcoin, some are buying it so it only fill in to China's loss. As price is going up again recently, this could only mean that people are not afraid even if China banned ICO and all negative issues release because no one can stop bitcoin. That's why the price still go up because many still use and buy it and sooner, it will soar up high.Bitcoin is not slave of any region that if he will refuse then there will be no other way, bitcoin is such a versatile and it has variable nature so that it can adjust every region into it and Chinese did wrong to themselves and they will cry on the split milk when they will see the development they will regret about their shitty decision.","October 13, 2017, 11:27:28 AM","Quote from: mrfaith01 on October 13, 2017, 10:22:44 AMYes you should...because of the chance of big earning you can get in bitcoin..but first study the site you want to invest with...to avoid in scam...Yeah you're right it is a yes to invest to bitcoin because as we can see the price of bitcoin is continuously growing which means you can earn more profit if you invest now.

The most smart and the most sensible decision is to invest into bitcoin because In bitcoin you invest at low and gain high profit and it will give you more than you expect and you can join the caravan of profiteers can gain a lot of money and change the way of living so invest and live epic life.it would be ""it is the wisest decision you've ever made if you want to become profitable"". bitcoin is not only for investments, you can also use it to do trading and do gambling, but its too risky, so better to choose one decision to multiply it.There are numerous ways of earning and using bitcoin. People are trying all these methods of making grand profits with bitcoin whether they are trading, gambling or mining.

Many people earning a big amount of bitcoin because of investing. I want also this way og earning but i dont have enough knowledge in that kind of way here in bitcoin. I only prefer to join in a signature campaign. If you are a participant of a signature campaign, then you must be earning in bitcoin already. Simply holding on to them will make you rich in near future but if you want to earn extra bitcoin, then trading can help you. For that you must first decide whether you want to be a day trader or not. It is better to hold on bitcoin as far as the price is rising up and when there will be a downfall for 12 to 15 hours, sell your coin and wait for the downfall and buy again. You just need to guess the starting of dump and pump phase. For now, you can buy a little fraction of bitcoin and start trading by just holding it on and sell out after prices get really high.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Today at 07:47:27 AM,"Quote from: Sithara007 on Today at 06:55:15 AMQuote from: R.Hasan on Today at 05:19:02 AMThe tendency to procreate without restraint is supported by ""religious leaders"", which depend on big families. The Catholic church & Islam in particular opposes any contraception or abortion. Encouragement of procreation is in the best interest of the ""churchs"". The Islamic view used to approve having more children (""increasing the size of the ummah""), the religious establishment does not recognize that it is self-destructive. Religious people believe that when they die they will go to heaven and their Gods will miraculously provide them with all necessities. Why bother? Why worry about overpopulation or global warming? Even if it results in human deaths, there is always life in the heavenly kingdom.  And so the emotionally dissociated people multiply without restraint.It is ironic that some of the Catholic nations have the lowest birth rates in the world. A few examples are Italy, Poland, and Spain. These nations, on average are having fertility rates close to 1.30 children per woman. On the other hand, most of the Orthodox nations are having fertility rates ranging from 1.50 to 1.80 (like Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_and_the_Catholic_Church",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Today at 04:40:40 PM,"Yes and you should invest in Bitcoin.  Investing in bitcoins is one of the smartest moves you can make right now.  I see the price easily reaching $10,000.

Its just a basic mathematics 1+1 should not be more than 2. By doing this you can control population and eventually lower it down. If two people marry and had a family they should be limited on having 2 child. But this is impossible to do now, why? This will have a negative effect on a country's economy. When you limit the number of child per family it is like limiting your working force in the future.China had a one child policy years before to control their population but eventually stopped it because 15-30 years after its implementation it will decrease their work force by half.So the best solution for over population the moral way is to have another space to occupy.
